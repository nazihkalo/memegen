  \ About Forever Alone is an exploitable rage comic character that is used to express\
  \ loneliness and disappointment with life. The face has also been used as an advice\
  \ animal and inspired the creation of the snowclone template \"Forever an X.\" Origin\
  \ Forever Alone is considered one of the first major rage comic spin-off characters\
  \ to be creater after the original Rage Guy, which first sprang up on 4chan in 2009.\
  \ According to various sources, the original comic was uploaded in a thread titled\
  \ \"April Fools\" by FunnyJunk user Azuul on May 28th, 2010 (shown below). While\
  \ the original artist has not been confirmed, Dictionary.com[24] cites Dominic Vanner\
  \ as the illustrator behind the character. Spread In early June 2010, another instance\
  \ featuring a bachelor salaryman was posted on 4chan (shown below, left). On August\
  \ 5th, 2010, Redditor L_E_G_E_N_D posted a Forever Alone rage comic titled \"Prom\
  \ FFFUUUU\"[14] (shown below, right), receiving over 275 up votes and 70 comments\
  \ prior to being archived. By September 2010, there were over 23,000 image results\
  \ for \"Forever Alone\" on FunnyJunk[3] and over 50,000 on Tumblr.[4] On September\

  \ collection of four-pane comics. On September 15th, the /r/foreveralone[23] subreddit\
  \ was created, which received over 25,300 subscribers in the next three years. In\
  \ early October, Forever Alone received mentions in several blogs, including Geekosystem[5],\
  \ Memebase[15] and Uproxx.[16] Meanwhile, the meaning of term \"Forever Alone\"\
  \ gradually expanded from a rage comic reference to the more general statement of\
  \ being alone. On February 13th, 2013, the International Business Times[22] published\
  \ a slideshow of notable Valentine's Day Forever Alone comics and image macros.\
  \ As of February 2013, a Facebook[21] page titled \"Forever Alone\" has received\
  \ over 7.2 million submissions. Various Examples In the beginning, most rage comics\
  \ were illustrated with the the basic four-pane template, but later grew into other\

  \ Skim Online Forums[11] and Dating Service Reporter[12]. The sudden influx of heavy\
  \ traffic put a heavy strain on Earthcam's servers, resulting in a streaming outage\
  \ for viewers from 7 p.m. to 7:40 p.m. The few with access to the live stream took\
