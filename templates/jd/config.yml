scraped_content: 'About Joseph Ducreux (June 26, 1735 – July 24, 1802) was an eighteenth
  century French artist known for his unorthodox style of portrait paintings. On the
  internet, his eccentric self-portrait has inspired a series of exploitable macros,
  featuring "archaic reinterpretation" of popular rap lyrics superimposed over the
  artwork. Reminiscent of Bayeux Tapestry image macros, this highly verbose joke provides
  a satisfying challenge of "decoding" the corrupted lyrics back into to the original
  verses. Origin Portrait de l''artiste sous les traits d''un moqueur (English: Self-portrait
  of the artist in the guise of a mockingbird), which depicts Ducreux grinning smugly
  while pointing his finger towards the viewer, was completed circa 1793. Over two
  centuries later in 2009, Ducreux'' portrait was turned into an image macro with
  a caption reading "Disregard Females, Acquire Currency," an archaic reinterpretation
  of lyrics from Notorious B.I.G''s 1995 hit single Get Money. More recently, the
  line "F*ck Bitches, Get Money" was also featured in Lil Wayne''s 2005 track Money
  on My Mind. Since becoming popular on 4chan, Meme Generator and other lulz-friendly
  communities, the image macro has spawned an extensive pool of variations. Variations
  More in the Photo Gallery. The Artist Self-portrait, circa 1783 Joseph Ducreux was
  an unorthodox portrait artist, interested less in the classical ideas of portraiture
  used by later French artists like David and Ingres. Ducreux had more of what sequential
  art philosopher Scott McCloud might refer to as a “Formalist” approach, taking the
  medium to a new ground by tearing down the fourth wall between subject and audience
  by depicting himself pointing out of the canvas while grinning maniacally, reflecting
  his belief that facial features could be use to depict personality. Steve Buscemi
  Ducreux On April 8th, 2011, a Tumblr post featured an image with Steve Buscemi''s
  face photoshopped over Joseph Ducreux''s, and it was posted to Reddit the same day.
  The following day, a Quickmeme page was created with several image macros, often
  accompanied by text associated with The Big Lebowski, or other films that Buscemi
  has appeared in.'
