  \ \u2022 Recent Videos About Ugandan Knuckles is the nickname given to a depiction\
  \ of the character Knuckles from the Sonic franchise created by YouTuber Gregzilla,\
  \ which is often used as an avatar by players in the multiplayer game VRChat who\
  \ repeat phrases like \"do you know the way\" and memes associated with the country\
  \ Uganda, most notably the film Who Killed Captain Alex? and Zulul. The character\
  \ is associated with the expression \"do you know the way\", which is typically\
  \ spoken in a mock African accent and phonetically spelled as \"do you know de wey.\"\
  \ Along with the question in hand a VR user will start making \"spitting\" sounds,\
  \ followed by a \"mob like\" mentality. Unsuspecting VRchat users fall victim to\
  \ Ugandan Knuckles \"promise\" of showing \"de wey\". Only followed by a mass trolling.\
  \ Origin On August 7th, 2016, YouTuber VirtuallyVain uploaded footage of himself\
  \ roleplaying an African gangster in the game Call of Duty: Black Ops, saying lines\
  \ like \"Follow me, I know the way\" (shown below). Within two years, the video\
  \ accumulated 10.5 million views and 17,900 comments. On February 20th, 2017, YouTuber\
  \ Gregzilla uploaded a review of the 2013 platformer game Sonic Lost World, which\
  \ featured a parody animation of the character Knuckles (shown below, left). The\
  \ video subsequently gave rise to the Knuckles Sings remix series. Fans of the Twitch\
  \ streamer Forsen commonly reference various jokes related to Ugandan warriors while\
  \ playing the game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Additionally, viewers have been\
  \ known to stream snipe his channel while yelling various Uganda-related memes.\
  \ On September 15th, DeviantArtist[3] tidiestflyer released a 3D model based on\
  \ Gregzilla's Knuckles depiction (shown below). On December 22nd, YouTuber Stahlsby\
  \ uploaded a video titled \"You Do Not Know the Way,\" in which a swarm of VRChat\
  \ players wearing Ugandan Knuckles avatars troll other players by making clicking\
  \ noises and saying \"You do not know the way\" (shown below, right). [This video\
  \ has been removed] [This video has been removed] The line \"you do not know the\

  \ submitted TanksBlast's \"Ugandan Knuckles Tribe\" video to /r/youtubehaiku,[1]\
  \ where it received more than 400 points (93% upvoted) and 25 comments within 12\
  \ hours. On January 5th, Ebaumsworld[4] published an article about the meme titled\
  \ \"Ugandan Knuckles Is A Hilarious Meme That's Taken Gaming By Storm.\" On January\
  \ 7th, DeviantArtist tidiestflyer updated the 3D model page with a disclaimer urging\
  \ viewers to \"not use this to bug the users of VRChat.\" \"Please do not use this\
  \ to bug the users of Vrchat. Its community means a lot to me and it would hurt\
  \ me to see the rights of other users taken away and possibly restricted because\
  \ of how out of hand it can get. Showing off their creativity and what they are\
  \ capable of. For me\u2026.. I'm in college and don't have a lot of time to get\
  \ on like I would like to anymore\u2026 I remember making this and thinking\u2026\
  \ Well it could be funny to show off to my friends and possibly mess with users.\
  \ But I've learned what kind of things I'm really capable of making. Its always\
  \ fun to be the one with models no one else has access to. Because I can make anything\
  \ that I want to be. Its like\u2026.. Its like that special place for me. To get\
  \ away from the real world and be someone I'm not\u2026.. But right now. Vrchat\
  \ has become a meme ground and I feel I have helped to dig a grave for Vrchat. Soon\
  \ enough people are gunna get tired of all the memes that now pollute the servers.\
  \ And with 500 people trying to just enjoy an event, they cant because there just\
  \ isnt enough moderation to hold down the rampant amounts of memers. So please\u2026\
  . Think about the users that you're playing with. Before they are all gone\u2026\
  \ Don't let it be a second Second Life.\" The following day, Ebaumsworld[5] published\
  \ an article title \"Ugandan Knuckles Creator Says The Meme Has Gotten Out Of Hand.\"\
  \ The tidiestflyer update was subsequently removed. Racism Accusations The Ugandan\
  \ Knuckles character has been accused of promoting ethnic and racial stereotypes\
  \ against Africans, though defenders of the meme have claimed the character is merely\
  \ based on an appreciation for Who Killed Captain Alex? and Wakaliwood cinema. On\
  \ January 20th, 2018, YouTuber Drift0r published a video titled \"Is Ugandan Knuckles\

  \ company Razer tweeted a customer-created image featuring a swarm of Ugandan Knuckles\
  \ characters accompanied by the caption \"Razer is de wey\" (shown below). In response,\

  \ Knuckles meme (shown below). Meanwhile, the tech news site Gizmodo[6] published\
  \ an article titled \"Does Razer Know It Posted a Racist Meme?\" That day, Razer\
  \ tweeted that they had removed the post after discovering that \"the meme may have\

  \ 18th. December 2021 Resurgence In late 2021, hype surrounding the release of Sonic\
  \ the Hedgehog 2 inspired a resurgence in Ugandan Knuckles memes on Reddit, mainly\
  \ because of the addition of Knuckles into the cinematic universe voiced by actor\
  \ Idris Elba. When the movie's first trailer was posted on social media to platforms\
  \ like Twitter,[11] it received roughly 84,200 likes over six days. A meme format\
  \ called Do I Look Like I Need Your Power? emerged from the trailer which used Knuckles'\
  \ scene within the trailer as its reference. The first meme in December 2021 to\
  \ reference Ugandan Knuckles in conjunction with the new Sonic movie was posted\
  \ to Reddit by Redditor[17] MikeTony713 on December 12th. The meme (shown below)\
  \ received 28 likes over three days' time. Inspired by the \"Do I Look Like I Need\
  \ Your Power?\" format, Redditor[12] ProAssassin666 was the first to remix Ugandan\
  \ Knuckles into the new format. The meme (shown below) was posted on December 13th,\
  \ 2021, and received roughly 33,800 upvotes over two days. Inspired by the above\
  \ meme, multiple Ugandan Knuckles memes started ironically re-emerging across Reddit.\
  \ For instance, Redditor[13] mayonnaise219 posted a meme on December 13th (shown\
  \ below, left) depicting a grave digger digging up \"Ugandan Knuckles\" from the\
  \ grave. The post amassed roughly 8,200 upvotes over two days. Redditor[14] TheRetroVideoGamer\
  \ also posted a meme (shown below, right) that received roughly 6,300 likes over\
