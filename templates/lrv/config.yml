scraped_content: About Laundry Room Viking is an advice animal image macro series
  based on a Facebook photo of a guy treading his way through a flooded laundry room
  after Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Echoing the original caption "do the laundry
  they said, it will be fun they said," the series usually juxtaposes an overly optimistic
  statement quoted by someone else against the undesirable conditions in reality.
  Origin The original photograph was posted via Facebook as a profile picture on August
  29th, 2011 and the first captioned instance was posted sometime in September 2011,
  according to Redditor ShivamJ[7], a close friend of the man depicted in the image.
  Catchphrase The phrase "X they said, it would be Y they said" derives from the Franco-Belgian
  comic series Asterix[12], in which the phrase "join up they said, it's a man's life
  they said" (a very loose rendering of the French "Engagez-vous, rengagez-vous, qu'ils
  disaient," which more literally translates as "enlist, re-enlist, they told us")
  is, in the English comics, a running gag – being frequently spoken by disgruntled
  soldiers[13]. The vaguely Norse look of the man's helmet in the picture, combined
  with his disgruntled expression and humorously uncomfortable situation, likely evoked
  the Asterix reference. It is, however, currently unclear as to where the connection
  was first made. That the catchphrase has been in use outside of Asterix for some
  time[14] also muddles the origin. Spread The identity of the man depicted in the
  image remains little known, except that his first name is John. The image first
  came under spotlight on November 27th, 2011 after it was posted on 4chan's /b/ (random)
  board. The same image was subsequently re-posted on Reddit in a thread titled "/b/
  this morning,"[1] receiving over 468,000 views with a net score of 6,565 up votes
  and 5,481 down votes. In the following weeks of November and December 2011, the
  image quickly made its way around other internet humor sites including FunnyJunk[4],
  WeKnowMemes[2] and Daily Picks and Flicks.[6] The interest in the image macro series
  resurged in January 30th, 2012, when Redditor ShivamJ took Redditor Shaunre's request
  and posted the original photo which never left facebook. ShivamJ also gave Shaunre
  a bonus picture of John saluting. Notable Examples Following the Reddit thread in
  late Jaunary, a Quickmeme page[8] titled "Do the Laundry They Said" was launched
  to accomodate the rising demand of more image macros. Most variations of the image
  are cropped down in landscape dimension and captioned with the phrasal template
  "X, they said. Y, they said." Search Interest External References [1] Reddit – /b/
