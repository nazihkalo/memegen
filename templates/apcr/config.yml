scraped_content: 'About Almost Politically Correct Redneck is an advice animal image
  macro series featuring a photo of a young shirtless man with a mullet hairstyle
  standing next to a pickup truck. The captions typically portray the man as earnest
  and well-meaning but unaware of his own stereotypical redneck prejudice. Origin
  The man behind the photo is Zach Downey, a photographer who worked at the Lilly
  Library at Indiana University. According to a post on Reddit[18], Downey cut his
  hair into the mullet as a joke for his Halloween costume back in 2003. At the time,
  his wife, Tricia, snapped a quick shot of him the morning after Halloween and uploaded
  it online where it spread and became a meme. "Two of my friends were going out on
  Halloween as superheroes," Downey recalled. "They had special clothing, glitter
  on their faces, they went to a lot of trouble. I got some clippers and cut my hair
  in 10 minutes and I was the hit. The mullet is associated with rednecks or hillbillies
  for sure," he said. "I''m not like that, but I mean no disrespect. I have friends
  that I''d call and they''d call themselves rednecks or hillbillies. That''s fine.
  It''s just not me." According to the post, Downey had the haircut for just about
  16 hours. His wife posed him in front of friend Jen Owen''s 1979 GMC truck and took
  some photos the next day. Then they hauled out the clippers, cut the mullet into
  a mohawk, took more photos, shaved his head completely and snapped a few more. "Actually,
  and this was the plan all along, I donated my hair to Locks of Love. It''s kind
  of funny that some young person out there actually benefited from my haircut," Downey
  said. "Mullets of Love?" Originally uploaded to a mullet photo gallery website by
  a friend, it was named "Mullet of the Month" on the site, and after that, it spread
  to other places online. The photo was then used as early as July 2005 as a response
  photo on the internet humor site Fark. On July 3rd, 2005, Fark user sens posted
  the image[9] in response to a story claiming Toyota would be building a plant in
  Canada because they did not want to train southern Americans. The photo was used
  on Fark in this manner on at least 2 other occasions in 2005[10] and 2009.[2] On
  May 12th, 2012, Redditor IanL27 submitted an image macro to the Advice Animals subreddit
  in a post titled "I present to you: Somewhat Politically Correct Redneck"[11], which
  featured the caption "Not against gay marriage / unless the couple is colored."
  Within three days the post received over 3,700 up votes, earning 1124 points overall.
  Spread On May 13th, 2012, Redditor larkable submitted a post titled "A kid at my
  school was getting picked on for being a ''faggot'', so this guy gets up and grabs
  the bully by the throat and says this"[1] to the Advice Animals subreddit, containing
  an image macro with the caption "What''s wrong / with faggots, queer?" This post
  gained nearly 17,000 upvotes, 1971 points overall and nearly 600 comments. The following
  day, men''s humor blog Guyism[7] published a post titled "New Meme You Should Know:
  Almost Politically Correct Redneck", which reported that the meme was born out of
  North Carolina''s gay marriage ban earlier that week. The same day, BodyBuilding
