  English variations that use the same smug approach, usually judging how sexually
  attractive he finds a member of the opposite sex. Spread "Basement Dweller" entry

  to live is sucked by his daily marijuana regiment. He can be found working second
  shift at your local gas station. Lives in a perpetual state of "Getting his shit
  together." The meme became quite popular through web application sites like MemeGenerator[3]
