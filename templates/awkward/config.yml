  \ Awkward Penguin is an advice animal image macro series featuring a penguin lacking\
  \ both social skills and self esteem. The text typically narrates uncomfortable\
  \ life situations, highlighting an exceptionally clumsy or inelegant response. Origin\
  \ The original image was taken by nature photographer George F. Mobley[1] and posted\
  \ to illustrate a fact sheet on Ad\xE9li penguins for National Geographic's Wild\
  \ Animals site.[2] The Socially Awkward Penguin image macros began appearing on\
  \ 4chan as early as May 2009, following the explosion of either series like Advice\
  \ Dog and Courage Wolf. In an archived thread[16] from May 31st, 2009, a /b/ (random)\
  \ user names Socially Awkward Penguin as an explanation of the term \"advice animal.\"\
  \ Spread On August 30th, 2009, the single topic blog Fuck Yeah Socially Awkward\
  \ Penguin[6] was created. That year, Socially Awkward Penguin was mentioned on several\
  \ other 4chan boards including /co/ [17] (comics and cartoons) and /a/ [18] (anime\
  \ and manga). The first Socially Awkward Penguin mention on Reddit took place in\
  \ a comment thread[21] on September 25th, 2009. After the original poster, vanhookjosh,\
  \ was seeking help for his anxiety, Redditor parttimehuman used the reference to\
  \ reassure him that everyone has moments in life where they feel uncomfortable.\
  \ In July 2010, Buzzfeed[8] featured a series of Socially Awkward Penguin images,\
  \ followed by Smosh[9] that November. The next month, a series of notable images\
  \ was shared on internet culture blog Street Couch[20] and a Socially Awkward Penguin\
  \ Android app[7] was released. The first Quickmeme[10] instance was generated in\
  \ late December 2010.[11] The next year, the series was also featured on internet\
  \ media blogs Topcultured[22], Runt of the Web[23], and Geekosystem.[24] As of April\
  \ 2012, over 32,000 people have liked the Facebook page[13] associated with the\
  \ macro. It also has evolved into a popular hashtag on Tumblr[14] and Twitter[19],\
  \ to collect posts about awkward life situations. Notable Examples Jiffy Cabs Advertisement\
  \ Redditor Denying_Reality[25] posted a photo of a newspaper advertisement for Canadian\
  \ taxi company Jiffy Cabs featuring Socially Awkward Penguin on November 3rd, 2011.[15]\
  \ Memebase[26] users confirmed that the photo came from The Muse, a student newspaper\
  \ from the Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada. Reverse Memes Some Socially\
  \ Awesome Penguin macros were created as direct reversals of Socially Awkward Penguin\
  \ derivatives. For example, the image below shows an examples of Socially Awkward\
  \ Penguin, a Socially Average Penguin and a Socially Awesome Penguin derivatives\
  \ for the same social situation. Socially Awesome Penguin Socially Awesome Penguin\
  \ is the most popular derivation of Socially awkward penguin. Commonly depicted\
  \ as the antithesis of the original character, with the captions depicting the character\
  \ as popular, charismatic and sexually attractive. On January 13th, 2010, the \"\
  Fuck Yeah Socially Awesome Penguin\"[27] Tumblr blog was created, with the first\
  \ image macro featuring the caption \"Say a word wrong / create hilarious inside\
  \ joke\".[28] Although the image was watermarked by Meme Generator[29], the exact\
  \ date of creation is currently unknown. Socially Awesome Penguin follows a reverse\
  \ template style from Socially Awkward Penguin, having the penguin face the other\
  \ way and the background red instead of blue, matching with the characters being\
  \ the complete opposite of each other. On April 8th, 2010, a Socially Awesome Penguin\
  \ image macro with the caption \"Crush walks up to you in hall / have a quick chat.\
  \ You're meeting her after school\" was submitted to a Socially Awkward penguin\
  \ thread on 4chan's /b/ (random) board. On August 15th, a second \"Socially Awesome\
  \ Penguin\" Tumblr[30] was created. On January 3rd, 2011, a post with several Socially\
  \ Awesome Penguin derivatives was submitted to the /r/AdviceAnimals[31] subreddit\
  \ by Redditor Mano21, receiving 1,210 up votes prior to being archived. A Socially\
  \ Awesome Penguin Quickmeme[32] page was created the same month. On March 1st, 2012,\
  \ the Internet humor blog Smosh[33] published a round-up of notable Socially Awesome\
  \ Penguin derivatives from Tumblr and Reddit. The meme has continued to spread on\
  \ sites like FunnyJunk[35], Tumblr[34] and /r/AdviceAnimals[36] subreddit. As of\
  \ April 16th, 2012, the Quickmeme page[38] has received over 3,500 submissions and\
  \ a Facebook[37] page for \"Socially Awesome Penguin\" has accumulated over 990\
  \ likes. Hybrid Socially Awkward Penguin often appears in image macros with its\
  \ antithesis Socially Awesome Penguin. On May 12th, 2011, a \"Socially Awesome Awkward\
  \ Penguin\" Quickmeme[14] page was created, featuring macros with half of the image\
  \ portraying a successful social interaction and the other half describing a socially\
  \ awkward interaction. As of April 16th, 2012, the Quickmeme page has received over\
  \ 8,200 submissions. Getty Copyright Claim On September 2nd, 2015, the German tech\
  \ blog GetDigital[39] published a post revealing that Getty Images had threatened\
  \ the site with a copyright lawsuit for using Socially Awkward Penguin without permission,\
  \ requiring a payment of \u20AC785.40 in licensing fees. The post went on to highlight\
  \ to alternative images for the image macro series, featuring an illustration of\
  \ the penguin rather than the original Getty Images cut out (shown below). On September\
  \ 3rd, The Daily Dot[40] published an article about the copyright claim, which contained\
  \ a statement from Getty Images confirming that the company had pursued legal action\
  \ to protect copyright on the penguin image. \u201CWe believe in protecting copyright\
  \ and the livelihoods of photographers and other artists who rely on licensing to\
  \ earn a living and fund the creation of new works. Getty Images has an immense\
  \ responsibility to the 200,000+ artists we work with to ensure that their work\
  \ is properly licensed when used by commercial entities. Bear in mind that many\
  \ artists themselves are small businesses, and are entitled to be paid for their\
  \ work.\u201D In the coming days, other news sites published articles about Getty\
  \ Images legal action, including BoingBoing[41] and CBC News.[42] Search Interest\
