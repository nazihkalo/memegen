  \ primaries convention debates election vte William Jefferson Clinton (n\xE9 Blythe;\
  \ born August 19, 1946) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 42nd\
  \ president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party,\
  \ he previously served as the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979 and\
  \ as the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992. Clinton,\
  \ whose policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy, became\
  \ known as a New Democrat. Born and raised in Arkansas, Clinton graduated from Georgetown\
  \ University in 1968, and later from Yale Law School, where he met his future wife,\
  \ Hillary Rodham. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas\
  \ and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive tenures\
  \ as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system\
  \ and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected\
  \ president in the 1992 election, defeating the incumbent Republican Party president\
  \ George H. W. Bush, and the independent businessman Ross Perot. He became the first\
  \ president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation. Clinton presided over the\
  \ longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed\
  \ into law the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Violent Crime Control\
  \ and Law Enforcement Act but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform.\
  \ Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much\
  \ more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal\
  \ Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance\
  \ Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg\
  \ and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered\
  \ U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing\
  \ the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern\
  \ Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency.\
  \ Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act\
  \ which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo\
  \ I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process,\
  \ and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. Clinton won re-election in the\
  \ 1996 election, defeating Republican nominee Bob Dole and Reform Party nominee\
  \ Perot. In his second term, Clinton made use of permanent normal trade. Most of\
  \ the accomplishments of his second term were overshadowed by the Clinton\u2013\
  Lewinsky scandal, when it was revealed that he had been engaging in a years-long\
  \ sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In 1998, news of\
  \ the affair made tabloid headlines.[1] This scandal escalated throughout the year,\
  \ culminating in December when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives,\
  \ becoming the first U.S. president to be impeached since Andrew Johnson. The two\
  \ impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around perjury and Clinton\
  \ using the powers of the presidency to commit obstruction of justice. In January\
  \ 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate, where he was acquitted\
  \ two months later on both charges. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency,\
  \ the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such\
  \ surplus since 1969. Clinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval\
  \ rating of any U.S. president. His presidency ranks among the middle to upper tier\
  \ in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and misconduct\
  \ allegations have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office,\
  \ Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created\
  \ the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention\
  \ of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations special\
  \ envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton founded the Clinton Bush\
  \ Haiti Fund with George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He has remained active in Democratic\
  \ Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.\
  \ Early life and career Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August\
  \ 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[2] He is the son of William\
  \ Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who died in an automobile accident\
  \ three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley).[3]\
  \ Blythe had initially survived the crash, but drowned in a drainage ditch. His\
  \ parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous,\
  \ as Blythe was still married to his fourth wife.[4] Virginia traveled to New Orleans\
  \ to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents\
  \ Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[5] At a time\
  \ when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents\
  \ sold goods on credit to people of all races.[5][6][7][8][9] In 1950, Bill's mother\
  \ returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile\
  \ dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[5] The\
  \ family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[10]Clinton's birthplace home in Hope, ArkansasAlthough\
  \ he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton\
  \ turned 15[11] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward\
  \ him.[5] Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who\
  \ regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr. The physical abuse\
  \ only ceased after a then-14-year-old Bill challenged his stepfather to \"stand\
  \ and face\" him, though the verbal/emotional abuse continued.[12] Bill would eventually\
  \ forgive Roger Sr. for his abusive actions near the latter's death.[13][14] In\
  \ Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary\
  \ School, and the segregated Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student\
  \ leader, avid reader, and musician.[5] Clinton was in the chorus and played the\
  \ tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. While\
  \ in high school, Clinton performed for two years in a jazz trio, The 3 Kings, with\
  \ Randy Goodrum, who became a successful professional pianist.[15] In 1961, Clinton\
  \ became a member of the Hot Springs Chapter of the Order of DeMolay, a youth group\
  \ affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason.[16] He briefly considered\
  \ dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life:Sometime\
  \ in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official.\
  \ I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be John\
  \ Coltrane or Stan Getz. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine\
  \ doctor, but I knew I would never be Michael DeBakey. But I knew I could be great\
  \ in public service.[5] Clinton in Hot Springs High School's 1963 yearbook Clinton\
  \ began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to\
  \ argue the defense of the ancient Roman senator Catiline in a mock trial in his\
  \ Latin class.[17] After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical\
  \ and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him\
  \ realize that someday he would study law\".[18] Clinton has identified two influential\
  \ moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision\
  \ to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White\
  \ House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[12] The other was watching Martin Luther\
  \ King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him so much that\
  \ he later memorized it.[19] College and law school years Georgetown University\
  \ Clinton ran for president of the Student Council while attending the School of\
  \ Foreign Service at Georgetown University. With the aid of scholarships, Clinton\
  \ attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington,\
  \ D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in foreign service degree in 1968. Georgetown\
  \ was the only university where Clinton applied.[20] In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won\
  \ elections for class president.[21] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then\
  \ a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[5] While in college,\
  \ he became a brother of service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[22] and was elected\
  \ to Phi Beta Kappa. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[23]\
  \ Oxford Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship\
  \ to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in philosophy,\
  \ politics, and economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately,\
  \ a B.Phil. in politics.[24] Clinton did not expect to return for the second year\
  \ because of the draft and so he switched programs; this type of activity was common\
  \ among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study\
  \ at Yale Law School, and so he left early to return to the United States and did\
  \ not receive a degree from Oxford.[12][25][26] During his time at Oxford, Clinton\
  \ befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received\
  \ a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide\
  \ had an influential impact on Clinton.[24][27] British writer and feminist Sara\
  \ Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub\
  \ in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam\
  \ War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of\
  \ civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That\
  \ was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough\
  \ and you had to do something about such things\".[24] Clinton was a member of the\
  \ Oxford University Basketball Club and also played for Oxford University's rugby\
  \ union team.[28] While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary Doctor\
  \ of Civil Law degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically\
  \ for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having\
  \ \"a powerful collaborator in his wife\", and for winning \"general applause for\
  \ his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".[25][29]\
  \ Vietnam War opposition and draft controversy During the Vietnam War, Clinton received\
  \ educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[30] While\
  \ at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium\
  \ to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969.[5] He was planning to attend\
  \ law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully\
  \ to obtain positions in the National Guard and the Air Force officer candidate\
  \ school, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps\
  \ (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[31][32] He subsequently decided\
  \ not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program\
  \ that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National\
  \ Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that\
  \ because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would\
  \ subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain\
  \ my political viability within the system\".[33] Clinton registered for the draft\
  \ and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been\
  \ drawn as numbers\_1 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he\
  \ would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[34] Colonel\
  \ Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application,\
  \ suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft\
  \ and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992\
  \ presidential campaign:I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest\
  \ to Senator Fulbright's office that Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, should be admitted\
  \ to the ROTC program\_... I believe that he purposely deceived me, using the possibility\
  \ of joining the ROTC as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction\
  \ and get a new draft classification.[35] During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed\
  \ that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve,\
  \ which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was\
  \ unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[36]\
  \ Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether\
  \ to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign\
  \ by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used\
  \ Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[37][38] Clinton's 1992 campaign\
  \ manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he\
  \ declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of\
  \ whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[39]\
  \ Law school After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor\
  \ (J.D.) degree in 1973.[12] In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in\
  \ the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[40] They began dating\
  \ and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer\
  \ plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United\
  \ States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[41] The\
  \ couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[42]\
  \ Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's\
  \ effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters\
  \ on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term\
  \ mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[43] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[44] and then\
  \ unknown television director and filmmaker Steven Spielberg.[45] Failed congressional\

  \ history of Bill Clinton After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned\
  \ to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974,\
  \ he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in the conservative 3rd district\
  \ against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered\
  \ by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal.\
  \ Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton\
  \ by only a 52\_percent to 48\_percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas\
  \ attorney general. Defeating the secretary of state and the deputy attorney general\
  \ in the Democratic primary, Clinton was elected with no opposition at all in the\
  \ general election, as no Republican had run for the office.[46][12] Governor of\

  \ Clinton Clinton meets with President Jimmy Carter, 1978 In 1978, Clinton entered\
  \ the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest\
  \ gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected governor\
  \ of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer\
  \ from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest\
  \ governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history\
  \ of Arkansas.[47] Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the\
  \ \"Boy Governor\".[48][49][50] He worked on educational reform and directed the\
  \ maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee\
  \ on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle\
  \ tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift)\
  \ detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland\
  \ County, polled 31\_percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial\
  \ primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed\
  \ Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election\
  \ that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's\
  \ history.[12] After leaving office in January 1981, Clinton joined friend Bruce\
  \ Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[51] In 1982, he\
  \ was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective\
  \ with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office\
  \ from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy\
  \ and improved the state's educational system.[52] For senior citizens, he removed\
  \ the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[53]\
  \ He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated\
  \ welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals.\
  \ Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats\
  \ argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the\
  \ Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to\
  \ succeed at the national level.[53][54] Clinton delivered the Democratic response\
  \ to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National\
  \ Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[12]\
  \ Governor and Mrs. Clinton attend the Dinner Honoring the Nation's Governors in\

  \ In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top\
  \ priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards\
  \ Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well\
  \ as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's\
  \ education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported\
  \ by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational\
  \ education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher\
  \ competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a\
  \ special legislative session\u2014the longest in Arkansas history.[52] Many have\
  \ considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[12][53]\
  \ He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982\
  \ and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of\
  \ Little Rock (1990).[46] Also in the 1980s, the Clintons' personal and business\
  \ affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy\
  \ investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[55] After extensive\
  \ investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons\
  \ related to the years in Arkansas.[12][56] According to some sources, Clinton was\
  \ a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[57][58]\
  \ However he might have felt previously, by 1992, Clinton was insisting that Democrats\
  \ \"should no longer feel guilty about protecting the innocent\".[59] During Clinton's\
  \ final term as governor, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the\
  \ death penalty had been reinstated in 1976).[60] As Governor, he oversaw the first\
  \ four executions carried out by the state of Arkansas since the death penalty was\
  \ reinstated there in 1976: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection.[61]\
  \ To draw attention to his stance on capital punishment, Clinton flew home to Arkansas\
  \ mid-campaign in 1992, in order to affirm in person that the controversial execution\
  \ of Ricky Ray Rector, would go forward as scheduled.[62][63] Scandals and allegations\
  \ During his time as governor in the 1980s, Arkansas was the center of a drug smuggling\
  \ operation through Mena Airport. CIA agent Barry Seal allegedly imported three\
  \ to five billion dollars worth of cocaine through the airport, and the operation\
  \ was linked to the Iran\u2013Contra affair.[64] Clinton was accused of knowing\
  \ about this operation, although nothing could be proven against him.[65][66] Journalist\
  \ Sam Smith tied him to various questionable business dealings.[67] Clinton was\
  \ also accused by Gennifer Flowers to have used cocaine as governor[68] and his\
  \ half-brother Roger was sentenced to prison in 1985 for possession and smuggling\
  \ of cocaine, but was later pardoned by his brother after serving his sentence.[69]\
  \ During his time in Arkansas, there were also other scandals such as the Whitewater\
  \ controversy[70] involving the Clintons' real estate dealings, and Bill Clinton\
  \ was accused of serious sexual misconduct in Arkansas, including allegations of\
  \ using the Arkansas State Police to gain access to women (Troopergate affair).[71]\
  \ The killing of Don Henry and Kevin Ives in 1987 started various conspiracy theories\
  \ that accused Clinton and the Arkansas state authorities of covering up the crime.[72]\
  \ 1988 Democratic presidential primaries Clinton in 1986 In 1987, the media speculated\
  \ that Clinton would enter the presidential race. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas\
  \ governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary for governor,\
  \ initially favored\u2014but ultimately vetoed\u2014by the First Lady).[73] For\
  \ the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. He gave\
  \ the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National\
  \ Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it\
  \ was expected to be, was criticized for being too long.[74] Clinton presented himself\
  \ both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic\
  \ Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[53][75]\
  \ 1992 United States presidential election Main articles: Bill Clinton 1992 presidential\

  \ primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with\
  \ Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas\
  \ in the New Hampshire polls.[12] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife\
  \ Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges.[76] Their television appearance\
  \ was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second\
  \ to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls\
  \ and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory.\
  \ News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place\
  \ finish.[77] Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern\
  \ primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former\
  \ California governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win\
  \ a significant contest outside his native South.[12][75] With no major Southern\
  \ state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored\
  \ a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[75]\
  \ Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic\
  \ Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.[12]\
  \ During the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business\
  \ and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was\
  \ a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions\
  \ with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[78] Further\
  \ concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be\
  \ getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".[79] Clinton was still the governor\
  \ of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home\
  \ state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer\
  \ and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said\
  \ was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death.\
  \ According to both Arkansas state law and federal law, a seriously mentally impaired\
  \ inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental\
  \ impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution\
  \ was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to\
  \ counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.[57][80] Bush's approval ratings were around\
  \ 80\_percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush\
  \ compromised with Democrats to try to lower federal deficits, he reneged on his\
  \ promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly\
  \ condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[75] By election time, the\
  \ economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly\
  \ over 40\_percent.[75][81] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism,\
  \ but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan\
  \ and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention\u2014\
  with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform\u2014many moderates\
  \ were alienated.[82] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record\
  \ as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained\
  \ suspicious.[83] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous\
  \ elections switched their support to Clinton.[84] Clinton and his running mate,\
  \ Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up\
  \ support and pledging a \"new beginning\".[84] On March 26, 1992, during a Democratic\
  \ fund raiser of the presidential campaign, Robert Rafsky confronted then Gov. Bill\
  \ Clinton of Arkansas and asked what he was going to do about AIDS, to which Clinton\
  \ replied, \"I feel your pain\".[85] The televised exchange led to AIDS becoming\
  \ an issue in the 1992 presidential election. On April 4, then candidate Clinton\
  \ met with members of ACT UP and other leading AIDS advocates to discuss his AIDS\
  \ agenda and agreed to make a major AIDS policy speech, to have people with HIV\
  \ speak to the Democratic Convention, and to sign onto the AIDS United Action five\
  \ point plan.[86] 1992 electoral vote results. Clinton won 370\u2013168. Clinton\
  \ won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent\
  \ George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero\
  \ electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic\
  \ issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's\
  \ success.[84] Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican\
  \ rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election\
  \ gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[3] the first time one\
  \ party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held\
  \ the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[87][88]\
  \ According to Seymour Martin Lipset, the 1992 election had several unique characteristics.\
  \ Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which\
  \ harmed Bush. A rare event was the presence of a strong third-party candidate.\
  \ Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The\
  \ chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous\
  \ groups.[89] Presidency (1993\u20132001) Main article: Presidency of Bill Clinton\
  \ For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Bill Clinton presidency. Clinton's\
  \ \"third way\" of moderate liberalism built up the nation's fiscal health and put\
  \ the nation on a firm footing abroad amid globalization and the development of\
  \ anti-American terrorist organizations.[90] During his presidency, Clinton advocated\
  \ for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into\
  \ law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North\
  \ American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist\
  \ Third Way philosophy of governance.[91][92] His policy of fiscal conservatism\
  \ helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[93][94] Clinton presided over\
  \ the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[95][96]\
  \ The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69\_billion in 1998,\
  \ $126\_billion in 1999, and $236\_billion in 2000,[97] during the last three years\
  \ of Clinton's presidency.[98] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross\
  \ national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for\
  \ each of the years a surplus was recorded, the U.S. Treasury reported a gross debt\
  \ of $5.413\_trillion in 1997, $5.526\_trillion in 1998, $5.656\_trillion in 1999,\

  \ transition, Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd president of the United States\
  \ on January 20, 1993. Clinton was physically exhausted at the time, and had an\
  \ inexperienced staff. His high levels of public support dropped in the first few\
  \ weeks, as he made a series of mistakes. His first choice for attorney general\
  \ had not paid her taxes on babysitters and was forced to withdraw. The second appointee\
  \ also withdrew for the same reason. Clinton had repeatedly promised to encourage\
  \ gays in the military service, despite what he knew to be the strong opposition\
  \ of the military leadership. He tried anyway, and was publicly opposed by the top\
  \ generals, and forced by Congress to a compromise position of \"Don't ask, don't\
  \ tell\" whereby gays could serve if and only if they kept it secret.[104] He devised\
  \ a $16-billion stimulus package primarily to aid inner-city programs desired by\
  \ liberals, but it was defeated by a Republican filibuster in the Senate.[105] His\
  \ popularity at the 100 day mark of his term was the lowest of any president at\
  \ that point.[106] Public opinion did support one liberal program, and Clinton signed\
  \ the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow\
  \ employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This\
  \ action had bipartisan support,[107] and was popular with the public.[108] Two\
  \ days after taking office, on January 22, 1993\u2014the 20th anniversary of the\
  \ U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade\u2014Clinton reversed restrictions\
  \ on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by\
  \ Reagan and Bush.[109] Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and\
  \ rare\"\u2014a slogan that had been suggested by political scientist Samuel L.\
  \ Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[110] During\
  \ the eight years of the Clinton administration, the abortion rate declined by 18\
  \ percent.[111] On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation,\
  \ announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[112] Two days later,\
  \ in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled\
  \ his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting\
  \ taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[113] Clinton's\
  \ advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal\
  \ budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[114] President Clinton's attorney\
  \ general Janet Reno authorized the FBI's use of armored vehicles to deploy tear\
  \ gas into the buildings of the Branch Davidian community near Waco, Texas, in hopes\
  \ of ending a 51 day siege. During the operation on April 19, 1993, the buildings\
  \ caught fire and 75 of the residents died, including 24 children. The raid had\
  \ originally been planned by the Bush administration; Clinton had played no role.[115][116]\
  \ In August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which\
  \ passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15\_million low-income\
  \ families, made tax cuts available to 90\_percent of small businesses,[117] and\
  \ raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2\_percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated\
  \ that the budget be balanced over many years through the implementation of spending\
  \ restraints.[118] Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on the South Lawn, August\
  \ 10, 1993 On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding\
  \ a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through\
  \ a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's\
  \ legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The\
  \ plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized\
  \ lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the\
  \ health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the\
  \ program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[56] Despite\
  \ the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care\
  \ system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed\
  \ to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the\
  \ first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[53][56] On November\
  \ 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background\
  \ checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed\
  \ a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented\
  \ in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income\
  \ workers.[56] In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers\
  \ Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American\
  \ Spectator. In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged\
  \ that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of\
  \ Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones.\
  \ Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated\
  \ \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\"\
  .[119] Yitzhak Rabin, Clinton and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo Accords on September\
  \ 13, 1993 That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known\
  \ as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the\
  \ armed services provided they kept their sexual orientation a secret. The Act forbade\
  \ the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[120] The\
  \ policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to\
  \ serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional\
  \ Republicans and Democrats, including senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn\
  \ (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to\
  \ a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should\
  \ lift the ban\_... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden\
  \ by the Congress\".[121] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going\
  \ far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[122]\
  \ Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive\
  \ order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially\
  \ desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order\
  \ might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially\
  \ making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[53] Later in his presidency,\
  \ in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did\
  \ not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\".[123] The policy\
  \ remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual\
  \ orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[124] Remarks on the\

  \ into law.[125] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported\
  \ ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies\
  \ in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures;\
  \ there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came\
  \ chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of\
  \ Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes in favor and 200 votes opposed\
  \ (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and\
  \ one independent opposed). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed\
  \ into law by the president.[125] On July 29, 1994, the Clinton administration launched\
  \ the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov.[126] The site was followed\
  \ with three more versions, with the final version being launched on July 21, 2000.[126]\
  \ The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration\
  \ toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore\
  \ were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system\
  \ and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government\
  \ to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued\
  \ Executive Order 13011\u2014Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads\
  \ of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information\
  \ of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"[127] The Omnibus Crime Bill,\
  \ which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[128] made many changes to U.S.\
  \ crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty\
  \ to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise.\
  \ During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the\
  \ death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers,\
  \ and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\"[129] It also included\
  \ a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period.[130] After two years\
  \ of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans\
  \ in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[131] A speech\

  \ on HIV/AIDS projected that a cure for AIDS and a vaccine to prevent further infection\
  \ would be developed. The President focused on his administration's accomplishments\
  \ and efforts related to the epidemic, including an accelerated drug-approval process.\
  \ He also condemned homophobia and discrimination against people with HIV. Clinton\
  \ announced three new initiatives: creating a special working group to coordinate\
  \ AIDS research throughout the federal government; convening public health experts\
  \ to develop an action plan that integrates HIV prevention with substance abuse\
  \ prevention; and launching a new effort by the Department of Justice to ensure\
  \ that health care facilities provide equal access to people with HIV and AIDS.[132]\
  \ 1996 would mark the first year since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic that\
  \ the number of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses would decline, with the U.S. Centers for\
  \ Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even later reporting a significant 47% decline\
  \ in the number of AIDS-related deaths in 1997 compared to the previous year.[133][134][135]\
  \ Credit for this decline would be given to the growing effectiveness of new drug\
  \ therapy which was promoted by the Clinton Administration's Department of Health\
  \ and Human Services, such as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).[134][135]\
  \ Clinton's coat of arms, granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1995 On September\
  \ 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined\
  \ marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the\
  \ legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that\
  \ were performed in other states.[136] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House\
  \ gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political\
  \ decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions,\
  \ Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional\
  \ amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as\
  \ highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\".[137] Administration\
  \ spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be\
  \ far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\"[138]\
  \ Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot\
  \ to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had\
  \ to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\";[139]\
  \ others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan\
  \ Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\".[138] Despite this, it\
  \ has been noted that other than a brief written response to a Reader's Digest that\
  \ questioned whether he agreed with it, Clinton had made no documented reference\
  \ to the issue of gay marriage until May 1996.[140] In a July 2, 2011, editorial\
  \ The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as\
  \ an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst\
  \ policy moments.\"[141] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme\
  \ Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[142] Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first\
  \ president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[143] and\
  \ he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay\
  \ rights.[144] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial\
  \ executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security\
  \ clearances for LGBT federal employees[145] and the second outlawing discrimination\
  \ based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[146] Under Clinton's\
  \ leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more\
  \ than doubled.[147] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and\
  \ for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his\
  \ lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[148] Advocacy for\
  \ these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement\
  \ at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection\
  \ by the Human Rights Campaign.[144] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[149]\
  \ and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[150] He was later honored\
  \ by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[151] \"When I\
  \ took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the\
  \ Worldwide Web\_... Now even my cat has its own page.\" Bill Clinton's announcement\
  \ of Next Generation Internet initiative, October 1996.[152] The 1996 United States\
  \ campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by China to influence the domestic\
  \ policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and\
  \ involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.[153][154] Despite\
  \ the evidence,[153][155] the Chinese government denied all accusations.[156] As\
  \ part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal\
  \ Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30,\
  \ 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[157] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended\
  \ reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[158][159]\
  \ In November 1996, Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines,[160]\
  \ which was a bridge bomb planted by al-Qaeda and was masterminded by Osama bin\
  \ Laden. During Clinton's presidency, the attempt remained top secret,[161] and\
  \ it remains classified as of March\_2024[update], when Reuters reported having\
  \ spoken with eight retired secret service agents about the incident.[162] 1996\
  \ presidential campaign Main articles: Bill Clinton 1996 presidential campaign,\
  \ 1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and 1996 United States presidential\
  \ election 1996 electoral vote results. Clinton won 379\u2013159. Leading up to\
  \ the 1996 presidential election, Clinton's chances of being re-elected initially\
  \ seemed slim, partially due to his growing untrust among the general public due\
  \ to the Whitewater controversy[163][164] and the lopsided defeat of national Democrats\
  \ in the 1994 elections.[165][166] His approval rating got as low as 40 percent\
  \ in early 1995, which led to several high-profile Democrats suggesting he drop\
  \ out of the race.[167][168] However in mid-1995, as a result of a rebounding economy\
  \ and the growing unpopularity of congressional Republicans, public opinion of Clinton\
  \ steadily up-ticked[169][170][171] and early 1996 polls found he had a lead of\
  \ up to 20 points over his likely Republican opponent Bob Dole.[172] Unlike Bush\
  \ in the 1992 election, Clinton's incumbency greatly benefited him in the general\
  \ election,[173] as most Americans felt the country was going in the right direction.[174]\
  \ Along with Dole, Clinton once again faced Ross Perot, who was nominated by the\
  \ Reform Party, but he garnered significantly less support than he did in the 1992\
  \ election.[175] In the month leading up the election, pundits were predicting a\
  \ big win for Clinton, as his approval rating saw a high of 60 percent[176] and\
  \ pollsters finding he was favored with voters in over 30 states.[177][178][179]\
  \ On election day, Clinton won 379 electoral votes, securing reelection and defeating\
  \ Dole, who received 159 electoral votes.[180] Clinton garnered 49.2 percent of\
  \ the popular vote to Dole's 40.7 percent and Perot's 8.4 percent. With his victory,\
  \ he became the first Democrat to win two consecutive presidential elections since\
  \ Franklin D. Roosevelt.[181][182] Second term (1997\u20132001) Clinton (center)\
  \ with other world leaders attending the first G8 Summit, 1997 In the January 1997,\
  \ State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health\
  \ coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy\u2014a Democrat\u2014\
  and Orrin Hatch\u2014a Republican\u2014teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and\
  \ her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's\
  \ Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform\
  \ in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded\
  \ through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded\
  \ in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the\
  \ passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October\
  \ 1997, Clinton announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed\
  \ to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[183] In 1999, he signed\
  \ into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm\u2013\
  Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that\
  \ had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking,\
  \ and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[184] Investigations In November\
  \ 1993, David Hale\u2014the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton\
  \ in the Whitewater controversy\u2014alleged that while governor of Arkansas, Clinton\
  \ pressured Hale to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons'\
  \ partner in the Whitewater land deal.[185] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\
  \ investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in\
  \ the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton\
  \ maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.[186] Investigations by Robert\
  \ B. Fiske and Ken Starr found insufficient to evidence to prosecute the Clintons.[187][188]\
  \ The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access\
  \ by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head\
  \ of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received\
  \ from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject\
  \ individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[189]\
  \ In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible\
  \ evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial\
  \ and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking\
  \ the files.[190] On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House\
  \ Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though\
  \ the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed\
  \ without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the\
  \ firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed\
  \ by a brief FBI investigation.[191] Critics contended that the firings had been\
  \ done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the\
  \ involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[192] The House Government Reform and Oversight\
  \ Committee issued a report which accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed\
  \ their efforts to investigate the affair.[193] Special counsel Robert Fiske said\
  \ that Hillary Clinton was involved in the firing and gave \"factually false\" testimony\
  \ to the GAO, congress, and the independent counsel. However Fiske said there was\
  \ not enough evidence to prosecute.[194][193] Impeachment and acquittal Main articles:\
  \ Impeachment of Bill Clinton and Impeachment trial of Bill Clinton Clinton's impeachment\
  \ trial in 1999 After a House inquiry, Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998,\
  \ by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228\u2013206 to impeach him for\
  \ perjury to a grand jury[195] and voted 221\u2013212 to impeach him for obstruction\
  \ of justice.[196] Clinton was only the second U.S. president (the first being Andrew\
  \ Johnson) to be impeached.[197] Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations\
  \ that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old\
  \ White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[198] After\
  \ the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial\
  \ and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute\
  \ Grounds for an Impeachment\",[199] the House began impeachment hearings against\
  \ Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, Republican\
  \ leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998. Clinton in 2000 at Trump\
  \ Tower, shaking hands with future 45th and 47th President Donald Trump While the\
  \ House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there\
  \ was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely\
  \ with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were\
  \ for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's\
  \ testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he\
  \ may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's\
  \ sexual harassment lawsuit.[200] The obstruction charge was based on his actions\
  \ to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition. The\
  \ Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.[201] The Senate refused to meet\
  \ to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was\
  \ held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm\
  \ Williams & Connolly.[202] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February\
  \ 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 not guilty/45 guilty on the perjury charge[201]\
  \ and 50 not guilty/50 guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[203] Both votes\
  \ fell short of the constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and\
  \ remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no\
  \ Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[201]\
  \ On January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after\
  \ he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court he had engaged in conduct prejudicial\
  \ to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[204][205] On October 1, the\
  \ U.S. Supreme Court suspended Clinton from practicing law in the high court, citing\
  \ fallout from the Lewinsky scandal,[206] but rather than appealing the decision\
  \ he resigned from the bar entirely.[207] Pardons and commutations Clinton issued\
  \ 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[56][208]\
  \ Controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother,\
  \ Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making\
  \ regarding the pardons.[209] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to\
  \ investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James\
  \ Comey. The investigation found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part.[210] Clinton also\
  \ pardoned four defendants in the Whitewater Scandal, Chris Wade, Susan McDougal,\
  \ Stephen Smith, and Robert W. Palmer, all of whom had ties to Clinton when he was\
  \ governor of Arkansas.[211] Former Clinton HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, who pleaded\
  \ guilty to lying to the FBI, was also among Clinton's pardons.[212] Campaign finance\
  \ controversies Further information: Lincoln Bedroom for contributors controversy\
  \ and 1996 United States campaign finance controversy In February 1997 it was discovered\
  \ upon documents being released by the Clinton Administration that 938 people had\
  \ stayed at the White House and that 821 of them had made donations to the Democratic\
  \ Party and got the opportunity to stay in the Lincoln bedroom as a result of the\
  \ donations.[213][214] Some donors included Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Jane Fonda,\
  \ and Judy Collins. Top donors also got golf games and morning jogs with Clinton\
  \ as a result of the contributions.[214] Janet Reno was called on to investigate\
  \ the matter by Trent Lott, but she refused.[215] In 1996,\_it was found that several\
  \ Chinese foreigners made contributions to Clinton's reelection campaign and the\
  \ Democratic National Committee with the backing of the People's Republic of China.\
  \ Some of them also attempted to donate to Clinton's defense fund.[216] This violated\
  \ United States law forbidding non-American citizens from making campaign contributions.\
  \ Clinton and Al Gore also allegedly met with the foreign donors.[217][218][219][220]\
  \ A Republican investigation led by Fred Thompson found that Clinton was targeted\
  \ by the Chinese government. However, Democratic senators Joe Lieberman and John\
  \ Glenn said that the evidence showed that China only targeted congressional elections\
  \ and not presidential elections.[221] Military and foreign affairs Further information:\
  \ Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration Somalia Col. Paul Fletcher,\
  \ USAF and Clinton speak before boarding Air Force One, November 4, 1999 American\
  \ troops had first entered Somalia during the Bush administration in response to\
  \ a humanitarian crisis and civil war. Though initially involved to assist humanitarian\
  \ efforts, the Clinton administration shifted the objectives set out in the mission\
  \ and began pursuing a policy of attempting to neutralize Somali warlords. In 1993,\
  \ during the Battle of Mogadishu, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled\
  \ grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This\
  \ resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others,\
  \ and resulted in one being taken prisoner.[222] Television news programs depicted\
  \ the supporters of warlord Mohammed Aidid desecrating the corpses of troops.[222]\
  \ The backlash resulting from the incident prompted in a drop in support for American\
  \ intervention in the country and coincided with a more cautious use of troops throughout\
  \ the rest of the Clinton administration.[222] Following a subsequent national security\
  \ policy review, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were\
  \ approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.[223][224] Rwanda In April 1994,\
  \ genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware\
  \ a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was underway, long before the administration\
  \ publicly used the word \"genocide\".[225][226][227] Fearing a reprisal of the\
  \ events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.[228] Clinton\
  \ has called his failure to intervene one of his main foreign policy failings, saying\
  \ \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut\
  \ it down. And I regret it.\"[229] Bosnia and Herzegovina Clinton with the U.S.\
  \ delegation to Bosnia and Air Force personnel in a flight to Tuzla on December\
  \ 22, 1997. Clinton is seen alongside future President Joe Biden. In 1993 and 1994,\
  \ Clinton pressured Western European leaders to adopt a strong military policy against\
  \ Bosnian Serbs during the Bosnian War. This strategy faced staunch opposition from\
  \ the United Nations, NATO allies, and Congressional Republicans, leading Clinton\
  \ to adopt a more diplomatic approach.[230] In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed\
  \ Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on UN safe zones and pressure them into a\
  \ peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers\
  \ to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.[231] Irish\
  \ peace talks Clinton shaking hands with Gerry Adams outside a business in East\
  \ Belfast, November 30, 1995 In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending\
  \ a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with\
  \ the British government. In November 1995, in a ceasefire during the Troubles,\
  \ Clinton became the first president to visit Northern Ireland, examining both of\
  \ the two divided communities of Belfast.[232] Despite unionist criticism, Clinton\
  \ used his visit as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict, playing a\
  \ key role in the peace talks that produced the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.[233]\
  \ Clinton plays the saxophone presented to him by Russian president Boris Yeltsin\
  \ at a private dinner in Russia, January 13, 1994. Iran Clinton sought to continue\
  \ the Bush administration's policy of limiting Iranian influence in the Middle East,\
  \ which he laid out in the dual containment strategy. In 1994, Clinton declared\
  \ that Iran was a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" and a \"rogue state\", marking\
  \ the first time that an American President used that term.[234] Subsequent executive\
  \ orders heavily sanctioned Iran's oil industry and banned almost all trade between\
  \ U.S. companies and the Iranian government. In February 1996, the Clinton administration\
  \ agreed to pay Iran US$131.8\_million (equivalent to $256.05\_million in 2023)\
  \ in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in\
  \ the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight\
  \ 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[235] Iraq In Clinton's 1998 State\
  \ of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was\
  \ building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.[236] Clinton\
  \ signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 on October 31, 1998, which instituted a\
  \ policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not\
  \ provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[237][238]\
  \ The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert\
  \ Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton\
  \ announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to\
  \ his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy\
  \ to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while\
  \ working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its\
  \ people and with its neighbors.\"[239] American and British aircraft in the Iraq\
  \ no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times\
  \ in 2000.[240] Osama bin Laden Capturing Osama bin Laden was an objective of the\
  \ U.S. government during the Clinton presidency (and continued to be until bin Laden's\
  \ death in 2011).[241] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that\
  \ the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that\
  \ U.S. authorities rejected each offer,[242] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that\
  \ \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".[243]\
  \ In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden[244] and the 1998\
  \ bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people,\
  \ including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture\
  \ or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered\
  \ cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting\
  \ the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting\
  \ bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps\
  \ in Afghanistan. The factory was destroyed by the attack, resulting in the death\
  \ of one employee and the wounding of 11 other people.[245] After the destruction\
  \ of the factory, there was a medicine shortage in Sudan due to the plant providing\
  \ 50 percent of Sudan's medicine, and the destruction of the plant led to a shortage\
  \ of chloroquine, a drug which is used to treat malaria.[246] U.S. officials later\
  \ acknowledged that there was no evidence the plant was acknowledging manufacturing\
  \ or storing nerve gas.[247] The attack provoked criticism of Clinton from journalists\
  \ and academics including Christopher Hitchens,[248] Seymour Hersh,[249] Max Taylor,[250]\
  \ and others.[251] Kosovo Clinton during a briefing on Kosovo, March 31, 1999 In\
  \ the midst of a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province\
  \ of Kosovo by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Clinton authorized the use of\
  \ U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named\
  \ Operation Allied Force.[252] The stated reasoning behind the intervention was\
  \ to stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide)[253][254]\
  \ of Albanians by Yugoslav anti-guerilla military units. General Wesley Clark was\
  \ Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations\
  \ Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999.\
  \ The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping\
  \ force to be deployed to the region.[255] NATO announced its soldiers all survived\
  \ combat,[256] though two died in an Apache helicopter crash.[257] Journalists in\
  \ the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration\
  \ as false and greatly exaggerated.[258][259] Prior to the bombing campaign on March\
  \ 24, 1999, estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year\
  \ long conflict in Kosovo had been approximately 1,800, with critics asserting that\
  \ little or no evidence existed of genocide.[260][261] In a post-war inquiry, the\
  \ Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the\
  \ expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and\
  \ pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24.\"[262] In 2001, the UN-supervised\
  \ Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did\
  \ not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders,\
  \ rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\" with the intention being the forceful\
  \ departure of the Albanian population.[263] The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used\
  \ as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder\
  \ but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.[264]\
  \ Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities,\
  \ was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for\
  \ the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity\
  \ and war crimes for his role in the war.[265] He died in 2006, before the completion\
  \ of the trial.[265][266] China See also: 1996 United States campaign finance controversy\
  \ Clinton and Chinese president Jiang Zemin holding a joint press conference at\
  \ the White House, October 29, 1997 Clinton aimed to increase trade with China,\
  \ minimizing import tariffs and offering the country most favoured nation status\
  \ in 1993, his administration minimized tariff levels in Chinese imports. Clinton\
  \ initially conditioned extension of this status on human rights reforms, but ultimately\
  \ decided to extend the status despite a lack of reform in the specified areas,\
  \ including free emigration, treatment of prisoners in terms of international human\
  \ rights, and observation of human rights specified by UN resolutions, among others.[267]\
  \ Relations were damaged briefly by the American bombing of the Chinese embassy\
  \ in Belgrade in May 1999. Clinton apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.[268]\
  \ Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, President Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser\

  \ trade relations (PNTR) trade status to China.[269] The president asserted that\
  \ free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[270][271] In encouraging\
  \ Congress to approve the agreement and China's accession to the World Trade Organization\
  \ (WTO), Clinton stated that more trade with China would advance America's economic\
  \ interests, saying that \"economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way\
  \ street. It requires China to open its markets\u2014with a fifth of the world's\
  \ population, potentially the biggest markets in the world\u2014to both our products\

  \ Accords, which were signed at the White House on September 13. The agreement led\
  \ to the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in\
  \ October 1998, however, this did not end the conflict. He brought Israeli prime\
  \ minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together\
  \ at Camp David for the 2000 Camp David Summit, which lasted 14 days in July.[56]\
  \ Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which\
  \ the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely\
  \ after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[56]\
  \ Judicial appointments Main articles: Bill Clinton Supreme Court candidates and\
  \ List of federal judges appointed by Bill Clinton Ruth Bader Ginsburg accepting\
  \ her nomination to the Supreme Court from President Clinton, 1993 Clinton appointed\
  \ two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[273] and Stephen\
  \ Breyer in 1994.[274] Both justices went on to serve until the 2020s, leaving a\
  \ lasting judicial legacy for President Clinton.[275] Clinton was the first president\
  \ in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to\
  \ the federal courts.[276] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court\
  \ of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8%\
  \ of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were\
  \ women.[276] Public opinion Clinton's approval ratings throughout his presidential\
  \ career (Roper Center) Throughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating\
  \ fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged\
  \ from the high-50s to the high-60s.[277] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998\
  \ and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[278] According to a CBS\
  \ News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\_\
  percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest\
  \ ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[279] Clinton's average Gallup\
  \ poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61 percent, the highest\
  \ final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[280] Forty-seven\
  \ percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[280]\
  \ As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45\_percent\
  \ of Americans said they would miss him; 55\_percent thought he \"would have something\
  \ worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68\_percent\
  \ thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\"\
  \ than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58\_percent answered \"No\" to the question\
  \ \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\"[280] The same\
  \ percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\"\
  \ as a president, while 22\_percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\"\
  \ or \"poor\".[280] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You\
  \ can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics\u2014and he's done a heck of\
  \ a good job.\"[281] During his first term, roughly 7 in 10 Americans believed that\
  \ the media unfairly covered Clinton's character flaws, according to polling.[282]\
  \ A year after he left office, a Gallup poll found that 51 percent of respondents\
  \ said they approved of the overall job Clinton did as president.[283] In May 2006,\
  \ a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George\
  \ W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed\
  \ Bush in six different areas questioned.[284] A June 2006 poll by Gallup found\
  \ that 61 percent of Americans said they approved of the job Clinton did as president,\
  \ a 10-point increase from the 2002 poll.[285] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed\
  \ that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president\
  \ in U.S. history.[286][287] In 2010, 69 percent of respondents in a Gallup survey\
  \ said they approved of the job Clinton did as president, including 47 percent of\
  \ Republicans and 68 percent of independents. His sudden spike in popularity during\
  \ this time was attributed to Americans comparing him to then-incumbent Democratic\
  \ president Barack Obama, who had low approval ratings.[288] In 2014, 18 percent\
  \ of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters\
  \ regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third\
  \ most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[289]\
  \ The same poll showed that just 3 percent of American voters regarded Clinton as\
  \ the worst president since World War II.[289] A 2015 poll by The Washington Post\
  \ asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the\
  \ U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked\
  \ eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[290] Public image Main article: Public\
  \ image of Bill Clinton Clinton addressing the British Parliament on November 29,\
  \ 1995 Clinton was the first baby boomer president.[291] Authors Martin Walker and\
  \ Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue,\
  \ personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor\
  \ in his high public approval ratings.[292][293] When Clinton played the saxophone\
  \ on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as\
  \ \"the MTV president\".[294][295] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick\
  \ Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial\
  \ journalist Paul Greenberg;[296] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning\
  \ the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller,\
  \ Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[296] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout\
  \ his presidency.[297] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba starting\
  \ from the 1992 presidential election.[298] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred\
  \ to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\".[299][300] His prominent role in campaigning\
  \ for Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech\
  \ at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama\
  \ and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail,\
  \ earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[301][302] Clinton drew strong\
  \ support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement\
  \ of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[303] In 1998, Nobel\
  \ laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first black president\", saying, \"\
  Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born\
  \ poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from\
  \ Arkansas\".[304] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than\
  \ his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double\
  \ standards that, she said, black people typically endure.[304] Many viewed this\
  \ comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American\
  \ community.[305] Sexual assault and misconduct allegations Main article: Bill Clinton\
  \ sexual assault and misconduct allegations Clinton and Monica Lewinsky on February\
  \ 28, 1997 Several women have publicly accused Clinton of sexual misconduct, including\
  \ rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized\
  \ Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as\
  \ predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship\
  \ consensual at the time. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence\
  \ in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic\
  \ leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky\
  \ affair.[306][307][308] In 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit\
  \ against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton\
  \ denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge\
  \ Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[309] Jones appealed\
  \ Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission\
  \ to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[310] In 1998, lawyers\
  \ for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment\
  \ by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main\
  \ lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign\
  \ to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[311]\
  \ In October 1998, Clinton's attorneys tentatively offered $700,000 to settle the\
  \ case, which was then the $800,000 which Jones' lawyers sought.[312] Clinton later\
  \ agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[313] Bennett said\
  \ the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and\
  \ move on with his life.[314] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which\
  \ was held at the White House,[315] Clinton denied having sexual relations with\
  \ Monica Lewinsky\u2014a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge\
  \ of perjury.[316] In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her\
  \ in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\"\
  \ to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[317]\
  \ On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit,\
  \ accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's\
  \ account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[318] An attempt\
  \ by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing\
  \ justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele\
  \ sought an investigation against the former independent counsel for prosecutorial\
  \ misconduct.[319] Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped\
  \ her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.[320]\
  \ To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978\
  \ she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews\
  \ to the press.[321] Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome\
  \ sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition.[320] In\
  \ a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she\
  \ had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal\
  \ publicly.[320] The Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy,\
  \ beyond his impeachment in 1998.[322] In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which\
  \ shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially\
  \ in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well\
  \ as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual,\
  \ and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the\
  \ power differential between a president and a 22-year-old intern. In 2018, Clinton\
  \ was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he\
  \ said he had made the right decision in not resigning.[323] During the 2018 Congressional\
  \ elections, The New York Times alleged that having no Democratic candidate for\
  \ office asking Clinton to campaign with them was a change that attributed to the\
  \ revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.[322] However, former DNC interim\
  \ chair Donna Brazile previously urged Clinton in November 2017 to campaign during\
  \ the 2018 midterm elections, in spite of New York U.S. senator Kirsten Gillibrand's\
  \ recent criticism of the Lewinsky scandal.[324] Alleged affairs Clinton admitted\
  \ to having extramarital affairs with singer Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky.[325]\
  \ Actress Elizabeth Gracen,[326] Miss Arkansas winner Sally Perdue,[327] and Dolly\
  \ Kyle Browning[328] all claimed that they had affairs with Clinton during his time\
  \ as governor of Arkansas. Browning later sued Clinton, Bruce Lindsey, Robert S.\
  \ Bennett, and Jane Mayer, alleging they engaged in a conspiracy to attempt to block\
  \ her from publishing a book loosely based on her relationship with Clinton and\
  \ tried to defame him. However, Browning's lawsuit was dismissed.[329] Post-presidency\
  \ (2001\u2013present) Main article: Post-presidency of Bill Clinton Activities until\
  \ 2008 campaign In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against\
  \ Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[330][331] and later claimed to have opposed\
  \ the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[332] In 2005, Clinton\
  \ criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while\
  \ speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[333] The\
  \ William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was\
  \ dedicated in 2004.[334] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life,\
  \ in 2004.[335] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World,\
  \ which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[336]\
  \ Former president George H. W. Bush and Clinton in the White House Library, January\
  \ 2005 In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan\
  \ appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[337] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton\
  \ joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton\
  \ Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of\
  \ that year.[338] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared\
  \ in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[339] and traveled to the affected areas.[340]\
  \ They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[341] Based\
  \ on his philanthropic worldview,[342] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation\
  \ to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation\
  \ HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has\
  \ worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative\
  \ (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems\
  \ such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[343]\
  \ In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers\
  \ to stop selling sugary drinks in schools.[344] Clinton's foundation joined with\
  \ the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among\
  \ those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[345]\
  \ The foundation has received donations from many governments all over the world,\
  \ including Asia and the Middle East.[346] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh\
  \ announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30\_percent in developing\
  \ nations.[347] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative\
  \ energy, which was voted down.[348] 2008 presidential election Clinton speaking\
  \ at the 2008 Democratic National Convention During the 2008 Democratic presidential\
  \ primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary.\
  \ Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10\_million\
  \ toward her campaign.[349] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active\
  \ on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters\
  \ at home and abroad.[350] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks\
  \ in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there\
  \ was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[351]\
  \ Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters\
  \ behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[352] Such remarks led to apprehension\
  \ that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were\
  \ allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008\
  \ Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures\
  \ him that Obama is \"ready to lead\".[353] After Hillary Clinton's presidential\
  \ campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign\
  \ debt.[354][355] After the 2008 election In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea\
  \ on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling\
  \ had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[356] Jimmy\
  \ Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[356] After Clinton met with North Korean\
  \ leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[357][358] Since then, Clinton has been\
  \ assigned many other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy\
  \ to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1\_billion in\
  \ damages.[359] Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development\
  \ Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\"\
  .[360] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. president Barack Obama announced\
  \ that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's\
  \ recovery.[361] Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available\
  \ for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake.\
  \ While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince\
  \ SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's\
  \ deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the\
  \ South Korean company signed a contract at the U.S. State Department, ensuring\
  \ that the new industrial park would have a key tenant.[360] In 2010, Clinton announced\
  \ support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's\
  \ first environmental foundation.[362][363] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention,\
  \ Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[364] 2016 presidential\
  \ election and after Clinton campaigning at an election rally for his wife Hillary\
  \ who was running for President of the United States, 2016 During the 2016 presidential\
  \ election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, and made appearances\
  \ speaking on the campaign trail.[365] In a series of tweets, then-President-elect\
  \ Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[366] Clinton served\
  \ as a member of the electoral college for the state of New York. He voted for the\
  \ Democratic ticket consisting of his wife Hillary and her running-mate Tim Kaine.[367]\
  \ On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George\
  \ H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to\
  \ help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and\
  \ Texas communities.[368] Clinton with Vice President Kamala Harris and President\
  \ Joe Biden in February 2023 In 2020, Clinton again served as a member of the United\
  \ States Electoral College from New York, casting his vote for the successful Democratic\
  \ ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.[369][370] Clinton was one of the first\
  \ public figures to endorse Biden's re-election campaign in 2024, with him appearing\
  \ in interviews and fundraisers with various politicians and national figures. He\
  \ was also one of the most notable politicians to defend Biden after his critically\
  \ maligned first presidential debate on June 27, with him stating that \"bad debate\
  \ nights happen\" and continued to press support for him despite increasing demand\
  \ from the public and Democratic party requesting for him to drop out.[371] After\
  \ Biden withdrew his candidacy and vice president Harris replaced him on the ticket,\
  \ both Bill and Hillary Clinton endorsed her and praised Biden for his work in public\
  \ service. Clinton later gave a critically acclaimed speech at the 2024 DNC, where\
  \ he emphasized the Democratic Party's record on job creation and Harris' career\
  \ achievements as a prosecutor, Senator, and Vice President.[372] He later stumped\
  \ for Harris at various battleground states, where he met with supporters in small\
  \ towns and at campaign stops. At a stop in Michigan, Clinton caused a backlash\
  \ by criticizing Arab and Muslim Americans hesitant to support Harris due to her\
  \ pro-Israeli position, stating Israel had been \"forced\" to kill civilians during\
  \ its war with Hamas.[373] His comments led the Institute for Middle East Understanding\
  \ to state, \"Bill Clinton\u2019s racist and ahistorical remarks were meant to justify\
  \ the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land. The Harris campaign is doing\
  \ itself no favors attaching itself to that kind of hateful rhetoric\".[374] He\
  \ expanded on his comments in an interview with CNN shortly after, stating that\
  \ he was trying to appeal to both sides of the issue and highlighted his work with\
  \ Arafat and Rabin in the Oslo Occords, although his response still received sharp\
  \ condemnation from Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian-Americans.[375] After Harris lost\
  \ the general election to Trump, Clinton's remarks were brought up by critics and\
  \ pundits, who stated that they were the reason why Harris lost support among Arab-American\
  \ voters and why she fared poorly in the Muslim-populated cities of Dearborn and\
  \ Hamtramck when compared to previous Democratic candidates.[376] Critics also questioned\
  \ his relevance to the modern Democratic Party, with pundits stating that his centrist\
  \ policies and promotion of candidates who align with his views no longer work with\
  \ a party that has tried to rebrand itself after losing support amongst progressive\
  \ and populist supporters.[377] After the election, he and Hillary released a statement\
  \ congratulating president-elect Trump and vice-president-elect JD Vance, while\
  \ stating that Harris and her running-mate Tim Walz ran a \"positive, forward-looking\
  \ campaign to be proud of.\"[378] Clinton's second volume of memoirs, Citizen: My\
  \ Life After the White House, was published in November 2024.[379][380][381][382][383][384]\
  \ Post-presidential health concerns In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple\
  \ bypass surgery.[385] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for\
  \ a partially collapsed lung.[386] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia\
  \ Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary\
  \ stents implanted in his heart.[385][387] After this procedure, Clinton adopted\
  \ a plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors\
  \ Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[388] He has since incorporated fish and lean\
  \ animal flesh at the suggestion of Mark Hyman, a proponent of the pseudoscientific\
  \ ethos of functional medicine.[389] As a result, he is no longer a strict vegan.[390]\
  \ In October 2021, Clinton was treated for sepsis at the University of California,\
  \ Irvine Medical Center.[391][392] In December 2022, Clinton tested positive for\
  \ COVID-19.[393] In December 2024, Clinton was hospitalized after developing fever\
  \ at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington D.C..[394] Wealth\
  \ The Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency,\
  \ which were paid off four years after he left office.[395] Bill and Hillary Clinton\
  \ have each earned millions of dollars from book publishing.[396] In 2016, Forbes\
  \ reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240\_million in the 15\_years from\
  \ January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting\
  \ and book-writing).[397] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive\
  \ more than $153\_million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[398] In\
  \ May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than\
  \ $25\_million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton\
  \ also made $5\_million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time\
  \ period.[399] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of\
  \ 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5\_million and $25.5\_million, and that\
  \ in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons\
  \ made between $16 and $17\_million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former\
  \ president.[400] Clinton earned more than $104\_million from paid speeches between\
  \ 2001 and 2012.[401] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that\
  \ Bill Clinton has made more than $100\_million giving paid speeches since leaving\
  \ public office, and in 2008, The New York Times reported that the Clintons' income\
  \ tax returns[402] show they made $109\_million in the eight years from January\
  \ 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92\_million from his speaking\
  \ and book-writing.[396][403][404][405] Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches\
  \ each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic\
  \ groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[398][406][407][408]\
  \ Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Clinton $500,000 for a speech\
  \ in Moscow.[409][410] Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House\
  \ financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred\
  \ during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and\
  \ we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses,\
  \ for Chelsea's education\". She added, \"Bill has worked really hard\_... we had\
  \ to pay off all our debts\_... he had to make double the money because of, obviously,\
  \ taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family\
  \ members\".[404] Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein President Clinton with Epstein\
  \ and Ghislaine Maxwell in the White House, September 1993 In the early 2000s, Clinton\
  \ took flights on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet in connection with Clinton Foundation\
  \ work.[411][412] According to Epstein's attorney Gerald B. Lefcourt, Epstein was\
  \ \"part of the original group that conceived of the Clinton Global Initiative\"\
  .[413] In 2002, a spokesperson for Clinton praised Epstein as \"a committed philanthropist\"\
  \ with \"insights and generosity\".[414] While Clinton was president, Epstein visited\
  \ the White House at least 17 times between 1993 and 1995.[415][416] Years later,\
  \ Epstein was convicted on sex trafficking charges. Clinton's office released a\
  \ statement in 2019 saying, \"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible\
  \ crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with\
  \ which he has been recently charged in New York. In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton\
  \ took four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and\
  \ two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton\
  \ Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail\
  \ traveled on every leg of every trip. [...] He's not spoken to Epstein in well\
  \ over a decade.\"[411][417][418] However, later reports showed that Clinton had\
  \ flown on Epstein's plane 26 times.[419] In another statement Clinton said \"one\
  \ meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made\
  \ one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security\
  \ detail\". In July 2019 it was reported that Clinton attended a dinner with Epstein\
  \ in 1995, a meeting with Epstein that Clinton had not previously disclosed.[420]\
  \ Clinton reportedly used Epstein's private jet to visit Little St. James Island,\
  \ where Epstein resided,[421] on multiple occasions between 2002 and 2005.[422]\
  \ Virginia Roberts, later known as Virginia Giuffre, says in a lawsuit that while\
  \ working at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort[423] she was lured into a sex-trafficking\
  \ ring run by Epstein and while traveling with Epstein she saw Clinton on the island.[424]\
  \ In a 2011 conversation with her lawyers, Roberts stated that Clinton traveled\
  \ to Epstein's retreat on Little St. James in 2002.[425] According to Roberts, Epstein\
  \ told her that Clinton \"owes me favors\" when she asked what he was doing there.[426]\
  \ She also reportedly claimed that Epstein and Clinton had dined in the presence\
  \ of two girls aged approximately seventeen whom she believed Epstein had invited\
  \ to have sex with Clinton, but that Clinton showed no interest in them.[427] A\
  \ Freedom of Information Act request for United States Secret Service records of\
  \ visits Clinton may have made to Little St. James produced no such evidence.[424]\
  \ According to Epstein's flight logs, Clinton never flew near the U.S. Virgin Islands.[425]\
  \ In July 2019, a Clinton spokesperson issued a statement saying Clinton never visited\
  \ the island.[428][429] When he was personally asked by a journalist about his ties\
  \ with Epstein in a rally in Laredo, Texas in November 2022, Clinton said \"I think\
  \ the evidence is clear\".[430] According to former Clinton aide, Doug Band, Clinton\
  \ visited Epstein's island in January 2003.[431][432] In 2024, unsealed court documents\
  \ revealed allegations that Clinton had visited the offices of Vanity Fair and 'threatened'\
  \ the paper not to print stories about Epstein's sexual trafficking. Former Vanity\
  \ Fair editor Graydon Carter denied the incident ever took place.[433][434] Personal\
  \ life At the age of 10, he was baptized at Park Place Baptist Church in Hot Springs,\
  \ Arkansas.[435] When he became president in 1993, he became a member of Foundry\
  \ United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C. with his wife, a Methodist.[436] On\
  \ October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas, he married Hillary Rodham, whom he\
  \ met while studying at Yale University. They had Chelsea Clinton, their only child,\
  \ on February 27, 1980.[437] He is the maternal grandfather to Chelsea's three children.[438]\
  \ In December 2024, Clinton was admitted to the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital\
  \ where he underwent testing and observation after developing a fever.[439] Accolades\

  \ Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton\
  \ Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[461][462][463] Clinton was selected\
  \ as Time's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992,[464] and again in 1998, along with Ken\
  \ Starr.[465] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton\
  \ was among eighteen included in Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of\
  \ the 20th Century.[466] In 2001, Clinton received the NAACP's President's Award.[467]\
  \ He has also been honored with a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[468]\
  \ a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[469]\

  \ for Wolf Tracks and Peter and the Wolf.[472][473] The audiobook edition of his\
  \ autobiography, My Life, read by Clinton himself, won the 2005 Grammy Award for\
  \ Best Spoken Word Album,[472] as well as the Audie Award as the Audiobook of the\
  \ Year.[474] Clinton has two more Grammy nominations for his audiobooks: Giving:\
  \ How Each of Us Can Change the World in 2007 and Back to Work in 2012.[472] In\
  \ 2011, Haitian president Michel Martelly awarded Clinton with the National Order\
  \ of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross \"for his various initiatives in\
  \ Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country\
  \ after the earthquake of January 12, 2010\". Clinton declared at the ceremony that\
  \ \"in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents\
  \ need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe\
  \ in its promise\".[475] President Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal\
  \ of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[476] See also Clinton family Clinton School of\
