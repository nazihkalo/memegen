  \ Smith Slapping Chris Rock refers to a moment from the 2022 Oscars (held on March\
  \ 27th) in which actor and musician Will Smith slapped comedian and actor Chris\
  \ Rock over a joke he made about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith. The slap was televised\
  \ and quickly became an object-labeling and an exploitable meme template. The still\
  \ image of Smith hitting Rock in the face also became a source for redraws where\
  \ the two were replaced with pop culture figures. Origin During the 94th Academy\
  \ Awards ceremony on March 27th, 2022, comedian Chris Rock was presenting the award\
  \ for best documentary feature, which eventually went to Summer of Soul. While on\
  \ stage, Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith's wife (also known\
  \ from the Entanglement meme), and how because of her shaved haircut, she could\
  \ have starred in G.I.Jane. This prompted a mixed reaction from the crowd with Will\
  \ initially appearing to laugh but Jada visibly upset next to him (shown below).\
  \ Moments later, Will stands and walks up the stage to Rock and slaps him across\
  \ the head, which drew confusion from a crowd unsure if it was real or part of a\
  \ bit. As Will went back to his seat, continuing to shout at Rock, he appears genuinely\
  \ angry and yells, \"Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth!\" Though it was\
  \ censored for the American telecast, an uncensored Japanese version was captured\
  \ and tweeted out by Twitter user @bubbaprog[1] that night (shown below). The clip\
  \ accumulated over 38.5 million views, 126,500 retweets and 484,500 likes in eight\

  \ - Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth!! - I'm going to, okay? That was,\
  \ uh, the greatest night in the history of television. Spread The image of the slap,\
  \ which was captured from various angles as a highly televised event, quickly had\
  \ an explosion in memes the night of the 2022 Oscars. For example, Twitter user\
  \ evanssugarbaby[2] rapidly made and posted a meme on March 27th in which the logo\
  \ of the Chris Rock-led TV show Everybody Hates Chris was superimposed on the image\
  \ of him getting slapped (shown below, left). Reddit user Robecuba posted a meme[3]\
  \ onto the /r/dankmemes subreddit showing Chris Rock with the Minecraft HUD overlaid\
  \ and text showing him being in danger (shown below, right). Immediately following\
  \ the event, an anonymous 4chan[4] user posted an exploitable template of Will Smith\
  \ punching Chris Rock to the /tv/ board. In the following hours, the thread gained\
  \ over 235 replies, with multiple users sharing memes and redraws based on the template\
  \ (examples shown below). The exploitable is similar to the 2020 redraw trend Lev\
  \ Punch Edits. Developments Chris Rock Does Not Press Charges With LAPD Although\
  \ the slap was technically assault, Chris Rock did not press charges against Will\
  \ Smith following the slap. CNN[5] received a statement from the Los Angeles Police\
  \ Department following the Oscar's where they stated, \"LAPD investigative entities\
  \ are aware of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards program.\
  \ The incident involved one individual slapping another. The individual involved\
  \ has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report\
  \ at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report.\"\
  \ Memes and reactions ensued on Twitter amongst other platforms amid the development.\
  \ Some online believed that Rock should press charges while others thought it was\

  \ Crash Mar 28, 2022 at 01:48AM EDT Watched it live, kinda more surreal that everyone\
  \ thought it was a sketch, laughed and clapped till Smith began shouting swears.\
  \ It was like how people watch violence on the streets thinking it\u2019s a movie\
  \ or something. Then the surrealism went beyond that when Denzel and Tyler Perry\
  \ consoled the attacker and the whole place gave a standing ovation to the guy who\
  \ couldn\u2019t even apologize and instead \u2018hoped he\u2019d be invited back\u2019\
  . So I guess we\u2019re at a stage where female comedians can fondle males as jokes\
  \ but a hair loss joke is awarded a punch out. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t skip\
