  \ the years following the release of the film, the quote became parodied in the\
  \ headlines of several news articles, including Vulture[1], New York Magazine[2]\
  \ and Apartment Therapy[3] among others. By 2011, snowclone variations of the original\
  \ quote, most notably \"What is this? A picture for ants?\" and \"What is this?\
