  \ /\u02C8do\u028Ad\u0292/ DOHJ) is a slang term for \"dog\" that is primarily associated\
  \ with pictures of Shiba Inus (nicknamed \"Shibe\") and internal monologue captions\
  \ on Tumblr. These photos may be photoshopped to change the dog's face or captioned\
  \ with interior monologues in Comic Sans font. The primary meme and iconography\
  \ associated with Doge was the Shiba Inu named Kabosu, whose photos taken by her\
  \ owner Atsuko Sato in early 2010 went viral across the internet, spawning numerous\
  \ memes and larger trends in the following decades. Starting in 2017, Ironic Doge\
  \ formats gained prevalence over the original wholesome version as the memetic character\
  \ continued to evolve. In 2024, president-elect Donald Trump announced plans to\
  \ establish the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), named after the meme.\
  \ Origin The use of the misspelled word \"doge\" to refer to a dog dates back to\
  \ June 24th, 2005, when it was mentioned in an episode of Homestar Runner's puppet\
  \ show. In the episode titled \"Biz Cas Fri 1\"[2], Homestar calls Strong Bad his\
  \ \"d-o-g-e\" while trying to distract him from his work. Identity On February 13th,\
  \ 2010, Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato posted several photos of her rescue-adopted\
  \ Shiba Inu dog Kabosu to her personal blog.[38] Among the photos included a peculiar\
  \ shot of Kabosu sitting on a couch while glaring sideways at the camera with raised\
  \ eyebrows (shown below, right). In December 2013, shortly after the breakout of\
  \ \"Doge,\" the tech news site The Verge[39] published an article identifying Sato's\
  \ Kabosu as the original Shiba Inu depicted in the meme. In addition to Kabosu,\
  \ The Verge also identified \"Suki,\" a Shiba Inu who lives with San Francisco-based\
  \ photographer Jonathan Fleming, as the scarfed dog portrayed in another popular\
  \ instance of the meme. Spread On October 28th, 2010, a photo of Kabosu was submitted\
  \ to the /r/Ads subreddit[3] with the title \"LMBO LOOK @ THIS FUKKIN DOGE,\" where\
  \ it received 266 upvotes, 218 points overall and 48 comments prior to being archived.\
  \ Sometime in April 2012, Tumblr user leonsumbitches[15] uploaded an audio file\
  \ of a computer reading a passage written like the commands of a turn-based adventure\
  \ game about encountering a \"doge.\" The passage was paired with a photo of a woman\
  \ patting a dog on the head[16] and has gained more than 33,000 notes as of July\
  \ 2013. https://dailydoge.tumblr.com/post/21839788086/leonsumbitches-you-have-encountered-\uFF41\
  -\uFF44\uFF4F\uFF47\uFF45 In response, the single-topic blog Your Daily Doge[17]\
  \ was created but was quickly abandoned after reblogging leonsumbitches' post several\
  \ times. On May 7th, YouTuber KwandaoRen66 uploaded a video with a person reading\
  \ the text over a fake Pokemon battle.[4] By June, doge threads in which numerous\
  \ people shared photos of dogs in different outfits began appearing on 4chan boards,\
  \ including /v/[11] (Video Games). The same month, a photoset of a dog with a cup\
  \ and saucer balanced on his head went viral on Tumblr after airpi[14] referred\
  \ to it as \"Polite Doge.\" In August, the first doge single-topic blog, F--k Yeah\
  \ Doge[13], launched on Tumblr. The growth in the summer of 2012 coincided with\
  \ the popularity of the single topic Tumblr Shiba Confessions, as people began to\
  \ refer to these dogs as \"shibes.\"[18] In December 2012, the term \"doge\" appeared\
  \ on Reddit in a post submitted to /r/DogsIWannaHug.[6] The same month, an interior\
  \ monologue captioned photo of a Schnauzer was submitted to Cheezburger[5] with\
  \ the title \"Schnauze.\" On January 8th, 2013, the subreddit /r/Doge[7] was created,\
  \ sharing photos and videos of the captioned Shiba Inus.[8] In May, /r/dailydoge[9]\
  \ was created to share one dog photo a day, captioned or not. Another single-topic\
  \ blog, shibe-doge[12], launched in July 2013 dedicated to sharing Shiba Inu photos.\
  \ On July 29th, 2013, a doge thread[19] was sticky-featured at the top of the 4chan\
  \ board /s4s/ (Shit 4chan Says), garnering more than 600 replies. On November 20,\
  \ 2013, YouTube implemented an Easter egg, that changes the text to be colored and\
  \ in Comic Sans, much like the original internal-monologue style captions, when\
  \ a user searches the phrase \"doge meme\".[22] On Tumblr, in addition to the captioned\
  \ photos, the \"doge\" tag[10] often contains images of a Shiba Inu whose facial\
  \ features have been manipulated, similar to Starecat. 4chan's /r/Murica Raid On\
  \ the evening of August 26th, 2013, a group of users on 4chan raided against Reddit's\
  \ tongue-in-cheek patriotic forum /r/Murica[20], flooding the subreddit's frontpage\
  \ with dozens of photoshopped images depicting the Doge character in All-American-themed\
  \ settings (shown below). According to The Daily Dot's report[21], the raid started\
  \ late Sunday night and lasted until about 12:15 p.m. (ET) on August 27th, at which\
  \ point /r/Murica's moderators began removing Doge-related posts from the subreddit\
  \ index. Unlike previous clashes between the users of 4chan and Reddit, the sudden\
  \ influx of Doge images was reportedly met by little opposition from Reddit's user\
  \ base, reflecting the growing popularity of the character outside of Tumblr. Trademark\
  \ Controversy On June 24th, 2014, the California-based gaming accessory company\
  \ filed to trademark \"Doge\" with the United States patent office to sell card\
  \ boxes and playing card covers with Kabosu's likeness on the front. On June 23rd,\
  \ The Daily Dot[41] published an article about the trademark filing, which included\
  \ a statement from Ultra PRO General Manager Jay Kuo who claimed the trademark was\
  \ filed to protect the company from being sued and that they would allow \"royalty-free\
  \ use for any vendor who wishes to use the mark.\" The article also contained a\
  \ statement by the Intellectual Property Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation\
  \ Corynne McSherry, who noted that the filing is problematic because it attempts\
  \ to trademark the entire word, not just a stylized version of it.[40] Death Hoax\
  \ On March 31st, 2017, the Twitter account @CCTV reported that the Shiba Inu, Doge,\
  \ had died at age 16.[42] The tweet received more than 8,400 retweets and 13,100\
  \ likes. However, the tweet was an April Fools' Day prank. According to Kabosu's\
  \ official Instagram account, @kabosumama, doge is alive and well. @Kabosumama posted\
  \ a video of the dog (shown below), which received more than 4,600 likes and 22,600\
  \ views.[43] The post also contained the caption: \"Kabosu is OK, she is alive!\
  \ I don't care that somebody told the lie that Kabosu is dead for April Fools' Day,\
  \ but one important thing for me is \" Kabosu is a girl\", she is a female dog.\"\
  \ Dogecoin On December 6th, BitcoinTalk forum member Dogecoin introduced an alternative\
  \ cryptocurrency based on the meme as a satire of the Bitcoin boom in a thread[23]\
  \ titled \"Dogecoin \u2013 very currency \u2013 many coin \u2013 wow \u2013 v1.1\
  \ Released.\" Similar to Bitcoin and its derivatives, Dogecoin can be mined and\
  \ exchanged for goods and services among the participants, though it is programmed\
  \ to level out at a higher threshold of up to 100 billion coins and prevent any\
  \ use of special bitcoin-mining equipment like ASICs. In comparison, Bitcoin will\
  \ cap out at 21 million coins and Litecoin will support up to 84 million coins in\
  \ circulation. Following the launch of the official website,[24] a slew of social\
  \ media channels and referential webpages soon emerged for Dogecoin, including a\
  \ Twitter account[25] and a Facebook page,[26] racking up more than 1,000 followers\
  \ and 1,800 likes within the first week, respectively. On December 8th, an entire\
  \ subreddit community dedicated to the use of satirical cryptocurrency was launched\
  \ at /r/dogecoin,[29] accruing more than 2,600 subscribers in just over a week.\
  \ Throughout the first weekend of December, Dogecoin was highlighted by a number\
  \ of tech news sites and blogs, providing a further boost to the value of the satirical\
  \ currency.[35][36][37] By December 14th, an encyclopedic article[27] describing\
  \ the concept of \"Dogecoin\" had been submitted by Wikipedia editor CitationNeeded.\
  \ At its peak, the estimated value of DogeCoin skyrocketed to as high as $400.80\
  \ per coin (shown below).[28][31] As of December 15th, one Dogecoin (DOGE) is worth\
  \ about $ 0.0002 USD, with a market capitalization of $1.45 million USD and 7.2%\
  \ of the 100 billion total coins having been mined.[30][32][33][34] Political Examples\
  \ Several Republican politicians have highlighted Doge-style image macros on their\
  \ Twitter feeds. On December 23rd, 2013, Congressional Representatives Steve Stockman\
  \ and Thomas Massie posted political Doge image macros (shown below). On June 9th,\
  \ 2014, the official Republican National Committee Twitter feed posted a Doge image\
  \ macro mocking Bill and Hillary Clinton. The same day, the official Democratic\
  \ Party Twitter feed replied to the tweet mocking the use of Doge as being \"as\
  \ dated as your policies\" (shown below). Ironic Doge Memes Ironic Doge Memes are\
  \ memes that feature the Doge meme in strange or surreal circumstances. Many take\
  \ the form of image macros and often feature edits to the Doge image for the purposes\
  \ of dark or absurd humor. The format was popularized on deep iFunny and Facebook\
  \ between 2016 and 2017 and reached mainstream popularity in 2018, gaining prevalence\
  \ over the original wholesome format. Atsuko Sato and Kabosu Interview On February\
  \ 20th, 2020, Japanese nursery teacher Atsuko Sato, the owner of Kabosu (Doge's\
  \ real name), conducted an interview with Know Your Meme to learn more about the\
  \ origins of the meme and other details. Sato told KYM that Kabosu, 14 years old\
  \ at the time, was a rescue dog when she adopted her from a kill shelter years before\
  \ the meme. Kabosu's breeder went out of business, and she was rescued by an animal\
  \ welfare organization after being brought to an animal welfare center to be put\
  \ down, along with 19 other Shiba Inu. Most of the Shiba Inu that were brought there\
  \ with her were killed. Two years had passed since I lost my previous dog, and I\
  \ wanted to live with a dog again. I looked at the information about the new arrivals\
  \ that had just been advertised as looking for foster parents on the website and\
  \ found out about Kabosu. Sixteen days after being brought to the animal welfare\
  \ center, she became a member of my family. 2021 Doge NFT Auction In mid-June 2021,\
  \ the photographs taken of Kabosu by Atsuko Sato that later became the Doge meme\
  \ were auctioned off as a series of NFTs. On June 11th following the conclusion\
  \ of the auction, the Doge NFT sold for roughly $4.06 million (1696.9 ETH), setting\
  \ the record for the highest meme NFT auction ever. After the historic sale, Atsuko\
  \ Sato donated a significant portion of the money to various charities, which included\
  \ Plan International, Terra Renaissance, Florence, the Japanese Red Cross, World\
  \ Food Program, Ashi Naga and Japan Heart.[44] As Kabosu became a meme people love\
  \ so much, I came to believe that Kabosu was given a special mission by the universe.\
  \ Through the launch of these NFTs, I'd like to help children in need all over the\
  \ world. Kabosu and I would be very happy if we could help bring a smile to their\
  \ face. Doge / Kabosu Cancer Diagnosis On December 27th, 2022, Atsuko Sato announced\
  \ on her Instagram[45] account @kabosumama that Kabosu (Doge) had been diagnosed\
  \ with \"acute cholangiohepatitis and chronic lymphoma leukemia,\" noting that she\
  \ was in declining health but on medication to assist her recovery (seen below).\
  \ The news of Kabosu's cancer rapidly spread online shortly after, leading to an\
  \ outpouring of support around the web. View this post on Instagram A post shared\
  \ by \u304B\u307C\u3059\u30DE\u30DE (@kabosumama) In the following weeks and months,\
  \ Sato continued sharing updates on Kabosu's health as she slowly began to recover\
  \ somewhat, according to her Instagram. For example, on February 9th, 2023, Sato\
  \ said in an Instagram video that Kabosu was eating more food lately and doing therapy\
  \ as part of her treatment, among other things (seen below). View this post on Instagram\
  \ A post shared by \u304B\u307C\u3059\u30DE\u30DE (@kabosumama) On February 22nd,\
  \ 2023, Atsuko Sato then posted another update on Kabosu's status and shared images\
  \ of her latest blood test results to her Instagram,[46] which noted that it was\
  \ \"an incredible recovery\" as she thanked fans for their support. Doge / Kabosu's\
  \ Death On May 24th, 2024, Atsuko Sato announced on her Instagram[47] @kabosumama\
  \ and blog[48] that Kabosu (Doge) died at the age of 18 after struggling with cancer.\
  \ Sato wrote a message to Doge's fans, saying, \u201CTo all of you who loved Kabosu,\
  \ on the morning of the 24 May, Kabosu crossed the rainbow bridge. Thank you all\
  \ so much for your support over the years.\u201D The post (shown below) amassed\
  \ more than 64,000 likes in a few hours. Doge's death resulted in a massive outpouring\
  \ of tributes, sentiments and memorials online, such as a post to the /r/Dogelore[49]\
  \ subreddit on May 24th that received over 11,000 upvotes and 200 comments in 10\
  \ hours. Related Memes Wew Lad Wew Lad is an obfuscatory expression associated with\

  \ His real name is Balltze, or Ball Ball. In memes, he is known for liking cheeseburgers,\

  \ on Reddit in a post submitted to /r/DogsIWannaHug.[6] The same month, an interior\
  \ monologue captioned photo of a Schnauzer was submitted to Cheezburger[5] with\
  \ the title \"Schnauze.\" On January 8th, 2013, the subreddit /r/Doge[7] was created,\
  \ sharing photos and videos of the captioned Shiba Inus.[8] In May, /r/dailydoge[9]\
  \ was created to share one dog photo a day, captioned or not. Another single-topic\
  \ blog, shibe-doge[12], launched in July 2013 dedicated to sharing Shiba Inu photos.\
  \ On July 29th, 2013, a doge thread[19] was sticky-featured at the top of the 4chan\
  \ board /s4s/ (Shit 4chan Says), garnering more than 600 replies. On November 20,\
  \ 2013, YouTube implemented an Easter egg, that changes the text to be colored and\
  \ in Comic Sans, much like the original internal-monologue style captions, when\
  \ a user searches the phrase \"doge meme\".[22] On Tumblr, in addition to the captioned\
  \ photos, the \"doge\" tag[10] often contains images of a Shiba Inu whose facial\
  \ features have been manipulated, similar to Starecat. 4chan's /r/Murica Raid On\
  \ the evening of August 26th, 2013, a group of users on 4chan raided against Reddit's\
  \ tongue-in-cheek patriotic forum /r/Murica[20], flooding the subreddit's frontpage\
  \ with dozens of photoshopped images depicting the Doge character in All-American-themed\
  \ settings (shown below). According to The Daily Dot's report[21], the raid started\
  \ late Sunday night and lasted until about 12:15 p.m. (ET) on August 27th, at which\
  \ point /r/Murica's moderators began removing Doge-related posts from the subreddit\
  \ index. Unlike previous clashes between the users of 4chan and Reddit, the sudden\
  \ influx of Doge images was reportedly met by little opposition from Reddit's user\
  \ base, reflecting the growing popularity of the character outside of Tumblr. Trademark\
  \ Controversy On June 24th, 2014, the California-based gaming accessory company\
  \ filed to trademark \"Doge\" with the United States patent office to sell card\
  \ boxes and playing card covers with Kabosu's likeness on the front. On June 23rd,\
  \ The Daily Dot[41] published an article about the trademark filing, which included\
  \ a statement from Ultra PRO General Manager Jay Kuo who claimed the trademark was\
  \ filed to protect the company from being sued and that they would allow \"royalty-free\
  \ use for any vendor who wishes to use the mark.\" The article also contained a\
  \ statement by the Intellectual Property Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation\
  \ Corynne McSherry, who noted that the filing is problematic because it attempts\
  \ to trademark the entire word, not just a stylized version of it.[40] Death Hoax\
  \ On March 31st, 2017, the Twitter account @CCTV reported that the Shiba Inu, Doge,\
  \ had died at age 16.[42] The tweet received more than 8,400 retweets and 13,100\
  \ likes. However, the tweet was an April Fools' Day prank. According to Kabosu's\
  \ official Instagram account, @kabosumama, doge is alive and well. @Kabosumama posted\
  \ a video of the dog (shown below), which received more than 4,600 likes and 22,600\
  \ views.[43] The post also contained the caption: \"Kabosu is OK, she is alive!\
  \ I don't care that somebody told the lie that Kabosu is dead for April Fools' Day,\
  \ but one important thing for me is \" Kabosu is a girl\", she is a female dog.\"\
  \ Dogecoin On December 6th, BitcoinTalk forum member Dogecoin introduced an alternative\
  \ cryptocurrency based on the meme as a satire of the Bitcoin boom in a thread[23]\
  \ titled \"Dogecoin \u2013 very currency \u2013 many coin \u2013 wow \u2013 v1.1\
  \ Released.\" Similar to Bitcoin and its derivatives, Dogecoin can be mined and\
  \ exchanged for goods and services among the participants, though it is programmed\
  \ to level out at a higher threshold of up to 100 billion coins and prevent any\
  \ use of special bitcoin-mining equipment like ASICs. In comparison, Bitcoin will\
  \ cap out at 21 million coins and Litecoin will support up to 84 million coins in\
  \ circulation. Following the launch of the official website,[24] a slew of social\
  \ media channels and referential webpages soon emerged for Dogecoin, including a\
  \ Twitter account[25] and a Facebook page,[26] racking up more than 1,000 followers\
  \ and 1,800 likes within the first week, respectively. On December 8th, an entire\
  \ subreddit community dedicated to the use of satirical cryptocurrency was launched\
  \ at /r/dogecoin,[29] accruing more than 2,600 subscribers in just over a week.\
  \ Throughout the first weekend of December, Dogecoin was highlighted by a number\
  \ of tech news sites and blogs, providing a further boost to the value of the satirical\
  \ currency.[35][36][37] By December 14th, an encyclopedic article[27] describing\
  \ the concept of \"Dogecoin\" had been submitted by Wikipedia editor CitationNeeded.\
  \ At its peak, the estimated value of DogeCoin skyrocketed to as high as $400.80\
  \ per coin (shown below).[28][31] As of December 15th, one Dogecoin (DOGE) is worth\
  \ about $ 0.0002 USD, with a market capitalization of $1.45 million USD and 7.2%\
  \ of the 100 billion total coins having been mined.[30][32][33][34] Political Examples\
  \ Several Republican politicians have highlighted Doge-style image macros on their\
  \ Twitter feeds. On December 23rd, 2013, Congressional Representatives Steve Stockman\
  \ and Thomas Massie posted political Doge image macros (shown below). On June 9th,\
  \ 2014, the official Republican National Committee Twitter feed posted a Doge image\
  \ macro mocking Bill and Hillary Clinton. The same day, the official Democratic\
  \ Party Twitter feed replied to the tweet mocking the use of Doge as being \"as\
  \ dated as your policies\" (shown below). Ironic Doge Memes Ironic Doge Memes are\
  \ memes that feature the Doge meme in strange or surreal circumstances. Many take\
  \ the form of image macros and often feature edits to the Doge image for the purposes\
  \ of dark or absurd humor. The format was popularized on deep iFunny and Facebook\
  \ between 2016 and 2017 and reached mainstream popularity in 2018, gaining prevalence\
  \ over the original wholesome format. Atsuko Sato and Kabosu Interview On February\
  \ 20th, 2020, Japanese nursery teacher Atsuko Sato, the owner of Kabosu (Doge's\
  \ real name), conducted an interview with Know Your Meme to learn more about the\
  \ origins of the meme and other details. Sato told KYM that Kabosu, 14 years old\
  \ at the time, was a rescue dog when she adopted her from a kill shelter years before\
  \ the meme. Kabosu's breeder went out of business, and she was rescued by an animal\
  \ welfare organization after being brought to an animal welfare center to be put\
  \ down, along with 19 other Shiba Inu. Most of the Shiba Inu that were brought there\
  \ with her were killed. Two years had passed since I lost my previous dog, and I\
  \ wanted to live with a dog again. I looked at the information about the new arrivals\
  \ that had just been advertised as looking for foster parents on the website and\
  \ found out about Kabosu. Sixteen days after being brought to the animal welfare\
  \ center, she became a member of my family. 2021 Doge NFT Auction In mid-June 2021,\
  \ the photographs taken of Kabosu by Atsuko Sato that later became the Doge meme\
  \ were auctioned off as a series of NFTs. On June 11th following the conclusion\
  \ of the auction, the Doge NFT sold for roughly $4.06 million (1696.9 ETH), setting\
  \ the record for the highest meme NFT auction ever. After the historic sale, Atsuko\
  \ Sato donated a significant portion of the money to various charities, which included\
  \ Plan International, Terra Renaissance, Florence, the Japanese Red Cross, World\
  \ Food Program, Ashi Naga and Japan Heart.[44] As Kabosu became a meme people love\
  \ so much, I came to believe that Kabosu was given a special mission by the universe.\
  \ Through the launch of these NFTs, I'd like to help children in need all over the\
  \ world. Kabosu and I would be very happy if we could help bring a smile to their\
  \ face. Doge / Kabosu Cancer Diagnosis On December 27th, 2022, Atsuko Sato announced\
  \ on her Instagram[45] account @kabosumama that Kabosu (Doge) had been diagnosed\
  \ with \"acute cholangiohepatitis and chronic lymphoma leukemia,\" noting that she\
  \ was in declining health but on medication to assist her recovery (seen below).\
  \ The news of Kabosu's cancer rapidly spread online shortly after, leading to an\
  \ outpouring of support around the web. View this post on Instagram A post shared\
  \ by \u304B\u307C\u3059\u30DE\u30DE (@kabosumama) In the following weeks and months,\
  \ Sato continued sharing updates on Kabosu's health as she slowly began to recover\
  \ somewhat, according to her Instagram. For example, on February 9th, 2023, Sato\
  \ said in an Instagram video that Kabosu was eating more food lately and doing therapy\
  \ as part of her treatment, among other things (seen below). View this post on Instagram\
  \ A post shared by \u304B\u307C\u3059\u30DE\u30DE (@kabosumama) On February 22nd,\
  \ 2023, Atsuko Sato then posted another update on Kabosu's status and shared images\
  \ of her latest blood test results to her Instagram,[46] which noted that it was\
  \ \"an incredible recovery\" as she thanked fans for their support. Doge / Kabosu's\
  \ Death On May 24th, 2024, Atsuko Sato announced on her Instagram[47] @kabosumama\
  \ and blog[48] that Kabosu (Doge) died at the age of 18 after struggling with cancer.\
  \ Sato wrote a message to Doge's fans, saying, \u201CTo all of you who loved Kabosu,\
  \ on the morning of the 24 May, Kabosu crossed the rainbow bridge. Thank you all\
  \ so much for your support over the years.\u201D The post (shown below) amassed\
  \ more than 64,000 likes in a few hours. Doge's death resulted in a massive outpouring\
  \ of tributes, sentiments and memorials online, such as a post to the /r/Dogelore[49]\
  \ subreddit on May 24th that received over 11,000 upvotes and 200 comments in 10\
