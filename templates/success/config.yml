  \ Sandcastles, is a reaction image of a baby at a beach with a smug facial expression.\
  \ It has been used in image macros to designate either success or frustration. In\
  \ early 2011, the original image was turned into an advice animal style image macro\
  \ with captions describing a situation that goes better than expected. Origin The\
  \ original image was taken by photographer Laney Griner of her then 11-month-old\
  \ son Sammy on August 26th, 2007. She posted it to both her personal Flickr account[1]\
  \ and put it up on Getty Images[6], which has since been removed. Spread As early\
  \ as January 2008, users on social networking sites like MySpace[3] began incorporating\
  \ the photo of Sammy into their profiles, either as their avatar or as part of the\
  \ page's layout. It was often paired with the phrases \"Ima Fuck you up\"[2] or\
  \ \"I Hate Sandcastles\" In May 2008, the image was made freely available on image\
  \ hosting site Pyzam.com[4] with a second child photoshopped in to the background.\
  \ It was reposted on humor sites Damn Funny Pictures[8] and Daily Haha[9] the next\
  \ month. This version was part of a photoshop thread on Russian-language social\

  \ on Tumblr called Fuck Yeah Success Kid[14] was started and collections of these\
  \ images were posted to humor sites Pleated Jeans[15] in July 2011 and Uproxx[16]\
  \ that November. There is also a category for Success Kid images on Ranker[17] and\
  \ Memebase[18] and a Facebook[19] fan page with over 4000 likes. Kidney Transplant\
  \ Crowdfunding Campaign On April 8th, 2015, Griner launched a crowdfunding page\
  \ on GoFundMe[25] to raise money for her husband Justin's kidney transplant (shown\
  \ below). On April 13th, The Daily Dot[32] published an article about the crowdfunding\
  \ effort, which included an email from Griner in which she revealed her husband\
  \ \"spends 12 hours a week in a dialysis clinic.\" On April 15th, Redditor IrishProf[26]\
  \ submitted an article about Griner's campaign page to the /r/UpliftingNews[25]\
  \ subreddit, where it gathered more than 3,900 votes (85% upvoted) in the the first\
  \ 24 hours. In the coming days, many news sites published articles about the GoFundMe\
  \ campaign, including Time,[27] E! Online,[28] Today,[29] IB Times[30] and Metro.[31]\
  \ Within one week, the page reached over $88,000 of its $75,000 goal. BuzzFeed Interview\
  \ On July 11th, 2020, Sam Griner appeared on the BuzzFeedVideos YouTube[34] channel\

  \ Copyright Lawsuit Against Former Rep. Steve King On January 23rd, 2020, Twitter[35]\
  \ user @ehananoki shared a screenshot from former Republican Iowa Representative\
  \ Steve King's Facebook page that shows him using the Success Kid meme to fundraise.\
  \ On that day, Success Kid's mother retweeted[36] the post, writing, \"Just so it\u2019\
  s clear \u2013 I have/would never give permission for use of my son\u2019s photo\
  \ to promote any agenda of this vile man or that disgusting party (shown below).\
  \ On January 27th, the Hollywood Reporter[37] reported that Griner's attorney sent\
  \ a cease and desist letter to King over his use of the meme, posting the full contents\
  \ of the letter to their article. King had until that Wednesday at 9:00 A.M to remove\
  \ the post, which he did. In part, the letter reads: \"You have a record of vitriolic\
  \ criticism of individuals who belong to protected classes or disadvantaged groups,\
  \ or who support legal rights that you condemn. The majority of U.S. consumers reject\
  \ your political and other views, often vehemently, as they have a right to do.\
  \ Those people may be repelled by any association with your politics and campaign\
  \ and, therefore, unwilling to purchase products from legitimate licensees of the\
  \ 'Success Kid' meme, an association you have unilaterally and unlawfully imposed.\"\
  \ On August 23rd, 2022, the Des Moines Register[38] reported that Griner filed a\
  \ lawsuit against King in December 2020 and it would be moving to a jury trial in\
  \ November 2022. According to the article, King said of the lawsuit, \"\"It is a\
  \ petty and politically motivated case of litigation persecution. I had no involvement\
  \ or prior knowledge whatsoever and the plaintiff and her attorneys know that.\"\
