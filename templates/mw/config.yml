  \ is a series of anecdotal stories that are narrated in the voice of the founder\
  \ and CEO of the U.S. clothing retailer Men's Wearhouse. Examples of the series\
  \ detail Zimmer's machismo and sexual escapades with colorful sexual metaphors.\
  \ Similar to Billy Mays copypasta, each story typically begins with his TV commercial\
  \ tagline \"Hi, I'm George Zimmer, founder and CEO of the Men's Wearhouse\" and\
  \ always ends with \"I GUARANTEE IT.\" Origin The first known instance of the copypasta\
  \ was posted via pop singer Ashlee Simpson's official fan message board on October\
  \ 23rd, 2004. Earlier that day, Simpson became involved in a scandal after she was\
  \ seen lip-synching during her musical guest performance on Saturday Night Live,\
  \ a late-night comedy program well-known for its traditionally live musical performances\
  \ by famous singers and artists. In response to the mocking threads posted by Simpson's\
  \ detractors and anti-fans, the singer replied to the thread by saying people should\
  \ just get over the mishap and move on. Shortly afterwards, a reader known as \"\
  George_Zimmer\"[1] on the message board responded to Simpson's post with the following\
  \ message: HI\u2026 I'M GEORGE ZIMMER \u2013 FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE MEN'S WEARHOUSE.\
  \ ASHLEE.. I WOULD LIKE TO FUCK YOU NICE AND DEEP IN THE SHOWER \u2013 YOUR FIST\
  \ CLENCHING HALF OF MY COCK AT THE BASE WHILE THE OTHER HALF SLOWLY PENETRATES YOU.\
  \ YOU WILL BE BLINDFOLDED WITH A HAIR FULL OF SHAMPOO WHILE RECITING THE LYRICS\
  \ TO THE BEATLES' ROCKY RACOON. WHEN YOU GET TO THE PART ABOUT GIDEON'S BIBLE, I\
  \ WILL IGNITE MY COCK FUSE AND BLOW A LOAD SO HUGE YOU'LL GROW AN ADAM'S APPLE.\
  \ I GUARANTEE IT. Although it remains little known whether the copypasta had existed\
  \ prior to the post on Ashlee Simpson's fan site, the unique style of anecdote became\
  \ widespread through reposts on General Mayhem and 4chan amongst other places. George\
  \ Zimmer George Zimmer was born in the state of New York in 1948. He joined his\
  \ father in the men's clothing business and became the founder and CEO of Men's\
  \ Wearhouse, a men's clothing retailer chain. Zimmer has appeared in many of his\
  \ company's TV commercials in which he famously utters the company slogan: \"You're\
  \ going to like the way you look. I guarantee it.\" Spread On that same day it was\
  \ posted on Ashlee Simpson's fan site, a similar version was posted on General Mayhem[2]\
  \ forum in a thread about Ashlee Simpson's Saturday Night Live performance. In May\
  \ 2006, the copypasta phenomenon spread over to YTMND[3] with the creation of \"\
  I Guarantee It!\" by one of the site moderators fyrestorm, who paired an obscene\
  \ drawing of George Zimmer with \"The Wings,\" the main theme of the 2005 romantic\
  \ drama film Brokeback Mountain. In the following month, YTMND user boomaga followed\
  \ up with another remix using both Zimmer's quote as well as another obscene quote\
  \ attributed to porn actor Peter North. George Zimmer copypasta has been also seen\
  \ on Facebook[4], MySpace[5], Wikipedia[6] and Urban Dictionary.[7] Notable Examples\
  \ 311 Edition I'M GEORGE ZIMMER, FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE MEN'S WEARHOUSE. MY SECRETARY,\
  \ FOLLOWING A BARBARIC BEAVER BEATING THAT SLOUGHED OFF HER UTERINE LINING MORE\
  \ EFFECTIVELY THAN HER OWN MENSTRUAL CYCLE, INFORMED ME THAT MY TWO LEAST FAVORITE\
  \ ARTISTS, 311 AND SCOTT STAPP, WERE RECENTLY INVOLVED IN A SCUFFLE. HISTORICALLY\
  \ A MEDIATOR, I FLEW IN MY LEARJET TO MEET THE TWO BANDS. THE TWO GROUPS WERE WHINING\
  \ LIKE ANNA NICOLE SMITH AFTER INHERITANCE MONEY UNTIL I PREPPED THE MEMBERS OF\
  \ 311 FOR THE IMPENDING IMPALEMENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE COATING OF NUT NECTAR, GLUING\
  \ THEM TO THE GROUND. AFTER SUSTAINING A BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD FROM MY\
  \ CROTCH CRUSHING CONCUSSION CANE, STAPP WAS TAKEN 'HIGHER' THAN EVER BEFORE AS\
  \ HE WAS BOUNCED LIKE A BABY UPON THE Z-MAN'S TWO-TON TROUSER-SCHNAUZER, WHILE THE\
  \ 311 MEMBERS WERE HELD CAPTIVE BY THEIR OWN ASSHOLES LIKE BOWLING BALLS. THE FORCE\
  \ FROM MY CULVERT-SIZED COCK SPLITTING STAPP APART WAS ENOUGH TO CAUSE HIM TO DEVELOP\
  \ DUAL PERSONALITY DISORDER. AS STAPP PROCEEDED TO BLEED TO DEATH, MY STEADFAST\
  \ SLUT-SPEARING SON-SIRING SKINFLUTE BURST THROUGH THE LEAD SINGER'S BVD'S, CAUSING\
  \ HIM TO BREAK OUT INTO A RAPE-INSPIRED RENDITION OF 'COME ORIGINAL'. I COULD ONLY\
  \ INTERPRET HIS SINGING TO INDICATE IT WAS TIME TO FINISH UP, SO I BURIED THE ALT-ROCK\
  \ GREAT IN A GOOEY GRAVE OF GONAD GOULASH. MY GROIN YETI IS NOW THE SIXTH MEMBER\
  \ OF 311, I GUARANTEE IT. Chuck Norris Edition HI, I'M GEORGE ZIMMER, FOUNDER AND\
  \ CEO OF THE MEN'S WEARHOUSE. I'D BEEN HEARING A LOT LATELY ABOUT THE MERITS OF\
  \ THIS CHUCK NORRIS FELLOW, SO I THOUGHT I'D PAY HIM A VISIT- ZIMMER STYLE. AS I\
  \ APPROACHED HIS HOUSE, I HEARD A TWIG SNAP BEHIND ME AND THEN OUT OF NOWHERE CAME\
  \ THE LEG OF THE ONE AND ONLY CHUCK NORRIS. LUCKILY MY REFLEXES WERE TOO FAST FOR\
  \ HIM. MY MASSIVE MASCULINE MEAT-PIPE BURST FORTH FROM MY FINELY-TAILORED TROUSERS,\
  \ ENSNARING HIS LEG WITH THE POWER OF A THOUSAND ANACONDAS. HIS ONCE POWERFUL INSTRUMENT\
  \ OF DEATH THUSLY DESTROYED, HE WAS COMPLETELY POWERLESS. I DECIDED THAT THAT UGLY\
  \ MUG OF HIS WAS NOT UP TO ZIMMER STANDARDS, SO I DETERMINED TO DELIVER A MAKEOVER\
  \ HE WOULDN'T SOON FORGET. HE BEGAN TO CRY LIKE A KITTEN UNDER A STEAMROLLER AS\
  \ MY PULSATING PELVIC PILEDRIVER DELIVERED BLOW AFTER BLOW TO HIS EVER-SOFTENING\
  \ SKULL. AS I FINISHED OFF MY FLESH-SCULPTURE, I REALIZED THAT I HAD FORMED HIS\
  \ HEAD INTO THE SHAPE OF DEVIL'S TOWER. THE SHOCK CAUSED ME TO LET FORTH A FLOOD\
  \ OF CAUSTIC COD CREME THAT BURNED OFF THAT RIDICULOUS STUBBLE HE CALLS A BEARD.\
