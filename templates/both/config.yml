  \ Videos About \"Why Don't We Have Both?\", also known as Why Not Both?, is a reaction\
  \ image and catchphrase that is used in response to various problems that involve\
  \ choosing between two options or solutions. Origin The expression \"why don't we\
  \ have both?\" was originally quoted by a child model in a TV commercial for the\
  \ Old El Paso at-home taco kit that contains both hard-shell and soft tortillas.\
  \ In the commercial, a group of Spanish speakers are seen arguing over the quality\
  \ of hard and soft tacos, to which the girl proposes \u201CWhy not both?\u201D with\
  \ a shrug and puts an end to the debate. Though it is unclear when the commercial\
  \ first aired, it was discussed online as early as September 2009.[1] Spread On\
  \ June 23rd, 2010, a Facebook fan page[2] for the girl in the commercial was launched,\
  \ though her off-screen identity remains unknown. On June 30th, 2011, one of the\
  \ first image macros based on a still shot from the commercial was posted to FunnyJunk,[5]\
  \ paired with a screen capture from an episode clip of Yo Gabba Gabba (shown below,\
  \ left). On July 21st, a second image macro was shared on the Cheezburger site Comixed[3],\
  \ attached to a question surveying the viewers if they would rather kill Justin\
  \ Bieber or Rebecca Black (shown below, right). On the following day, the Black\
  \ / Bieber comic was reposted to FunnyJunk.[4] On August 12th, 2011, the Yo Gabba\
  \ Gabba multi-pane image was reposted to the /r/Drugs subreddit[6], where it gained\
  \ 35 upvotes and 31 points overall. Sometime in October that year, \"Why Not Both\"\
  \ reaction images were shared for the first time on Tumblr.[7] In January 2012,\
  \ a \"Why Not Both\" Quickmeme[8] page was created, accumulating 3,300 submissions\
  \ as of May 2013. Throughout that year, \"Why Not Both\" images were shared on numerous\
  \ subreddits including /r/Trees[9] and /r/Funny[10], as well as several humor sites\
