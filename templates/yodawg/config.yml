scraped_content: 'About Yo Dawg, or Sup Dawg, is an image macro series based on portrait
  shots of American hip hop artist Alvin Nathaniel Joiner,[10] better known by his
  stage name Xzibit, and humorous captions that are composed around the recursive
  phrasal template "Yo Dawg, I herd you like (noun X), so I put an (noun X) in your
  (noun Y) so you can (verb Z) while you (verb Z)." Since rising to popularity in
  early 2007, the series has been considered one of the most well-known and longest
  lasting examples of recursive humor on the Internet. Origin The original image macro
  first appeared on 4chan in early 2007 and experienced a resurgence in late 2008
  on Reddit, Tumblr, and social networking sites. The Yo Dawg series has a unique
  characteristic in being recursive. This multi-layered structure in the Yo Dawg formula
  makes it reminiscent of the "strange loops" described in Douglas Hofstadter''s Gödel,

  that were originally used to promote the 2006 sports drama film Gridiron Gang, in
  which the rapper plays the role of a minor character named Malcolm Moore. MTV Pimp
  My Ride While Xzibit initially began his career in the entertainment industry as
  a rapper from Los Angeles, his mainstream breakthrough came almost a decade later
  as the host of the MTV show Pimp My Ride, which ran for six seasons from 2004 to
  2007. In the show, Xzibit gained a reputation for adding luxurious amenities and
  equipments like fish tanks, clothes dryers and fireplaces into the participant''s
  car, presumably without consent. Spread Derivatives Standard: {yo,sup} dawg, I herd

  has reached celebrities, Xzibit included. In one of his first tweets he decries
  his embodiment as a meme ( View Tweet ), which led to the creation of this image
