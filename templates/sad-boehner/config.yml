  \ (/\u02C8be\u026An\u0259r/ BAY-n\u0259r;[a][3] born November 17, 1949) is an American\
  \ retired politician who served as the 53rd speaker of the United States House of\
  \ Representatives from 2011 to 2015.[4] A member of the Republican Party, he served\
  \ 13 terms as the U.S. representative for Ohio's 8th congressional district from\
  \ 1991 to 2015. The district included several rural and suburban areas near Cincinnati\
  \ and Dayton. Boehner previously served as the House Minority Leader from 2007 until\
  \ 2011, and House Majority Leader from 2006 until 2007. In January 2011, he was\
  \ first elected Speaker and then re-elected twice. Boehner resigned from the House\
  \ of Representatives in October 2015 due to opposition from within the Republican\
  \ conference. In September 2016, Squire Patton Boggs, the third-largest lobbying\
  \ firm in the U.S., announced that Boehner would join their firm. It was also announced\
  \ that he would become a board member of Reynolds American.[5] Early life and education\
  \ Boehner was born in Reading, Ohio, the son of Mary Anne (n\xE9e\_Hall; 1926\u2013\
  1998) and Earl Henry Boehner (1925\u20131990), the second of twelve children. His\
  \ father was of German descent and his mother had German and Irish ancestry.[10]\
  \ He grew up in modest circumstances, sharing one bathroom with his eleven siblings\
  \ in a two-bedroom house in Cincinnati.[11] He started working at his family's bar\
  \ at age 8, a business founded by their grandfather Andy Boehner in 1938.[11] He\
  \ has lived in Southwest Ohio his entire life.[12][13] Boehner attended Cincinnati's\
  \ Moeller High School and was a linebacker on the school's football team, where\
  \ he was coached by future Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust.[21] Graduating from Moeller\
  \ in 1968, when United States involvement in the Vietnam War was at its peak, Boehner\
  \ enlisted in the United States Navy but was honorably discharged after eight weeks\
  \ because of a bad back.[22] He earned his B.A. in business administration from\
  \ Xavier University in 1977, becoming the first person in his family to attend college,\
  \ taking seven years as he held several jobs to pay for his education.[11] Early\
  \ career Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with\
  \ Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the plastics industry. He was steadily\
  \ promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he\
  \ was elected to Congress.[3] From 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of\
  \ trustees of Union Township, Butler County, Ohio. He then served as a member of\
  \ the Ohio House of Representatives from 1985 to 1990.[23] U.S. House of Representatives\
  \ Boehner in 1993 In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent Congressman Buz Lukens,\
  \ who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor. He was all but\
  \ unknown when he entered a Republican primary that included Lukens and former Congressman\
  \ Tom Kindness. Despite being dramatically outspent, Boehner won with 49 percent\
  \ of the vote.[24] He then handily beat his Democratic opponent, Greg Jolivette,\
  \ in the November election. He was subsequently re-elected to Congress 12 times,\
  \ each by a substantial margin. Boehner's closest races were those in: 2006, when\
  \ he defeated the Democratic Party candidate, U.S. Air Force veteran Mort Meier,\
  \ 64% to 36%;[25] 2008, when he defeated Nicholas Von Stein, 68% to 32%;[26] 2010,\
  \ when he garnered 66% percent of the vote in a four-way race against Democratic\
  \ nominee Justin Coussoule, Constitution Party nominee Jim Condit, and Libertarian\
  \ nominee David Harlow.[27] Gang of Seven and Contract with America During his freshman\
  \ year, Boehner was a member of the Gang of Seven which was involved in bringing\
  \ media attention to the House banking scandal.[28] The group also investigated\
  \ the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski.[24]\
  \ Later, he, along with Newt Gingrich and several other Republican lawmakers, was\
  \ one of the engineers of the Contract with America in 1994 that politically helped\
  \ Republicans during the 1994 elections during which they won the majority in Congress\
  \ for the first time in four decades. Republican leadership From 1995 to 1999, Boehner\
  \ served as House Republican Conference Chairman, making him fourth-ranking House\
  \ Republican behind Gingrich, Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.[24]\
  \ During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the Freedom to Farm\
  \ Act that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs\
  \ for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.\
  \ In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw Speaker Newt Gingrich's\
  \ public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted\
  \ \"coup\" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner\
  \ and Republican leadership chairman Bill Paxon of New York. According to their\
  \ plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner\
  \ and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out.\
  \ However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker and told his\
  \ chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.[29] On July 11, Gingrich met with\
  \ senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under\
  \ no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new\
  \ election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats\_\u2013\
  \ along with dissenting Republicans\_\u2013 would vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker.\
  \ On July 16, Paxon offered to resign from his post, feeling that he had not handled\
  \ the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership\
  \ group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.[30] After Republicans\
  \ lost seats in the 1998 elections, the House Republican leadership underwent a\
  \ reorganization. Armey and DeLay kept their positions, but Gingrich was replaced\
  \ by Dennis Hastert, and Boehner lost his position as conference chairman to J.C.\
  \ Watts.[24] Chairman of Committee on Education and Labor Boehner addresses the\
  \ 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) while serving as House Minority\
  \ Leader Following the election of President George W. Bush, Boehner was elected\
  \ as chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, serving from 2001\
  \ until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the Pension Protection\
  \ Act and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in\
  \ Washington, D.C.[31] Boehner and Senator Ted Kennedy authored the passage of the\
  \ No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which was signed by President George W. Bush\
  \ in 2002.[32] Boehner said that it was his \"proudest achievement\" in two decades\
  \ of public service.[33] Boehner was friends with Kennedy, also a Catholic, and\
  \ every year they chaired fundraisers for cash-strapped Catholic schools.[34] House\
  \ Republican Leader 2006 portrait of Boehner After DeLay resigned as majority leader\
  \ in 2005, Boehner, House Majority Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri, and Representative\
  \ John Shadegg of Arizona, all sought to become Majority Leader.[24] Boehner campaigned\
  \ as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called \"earmark\" process and\
  \ rein in government spending. In the second round of voting by the House Republican\
  \ Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous\
  \ position as majority whip, the no. 3 leadership positions in the House. There\
  \ was some confusion on the first ballot for majority leader when the first count\
  \ showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,[35] due to a misunderstanding\
  \ as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico Luis Fortu\xF1\
  o to vote.[36] After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections,\
  \ the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as the minority leader. While as\
  \ Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker Dennis Hastert, as minority\
  \ leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican\
  \ nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Nancy Pelosi. According\
  \ to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman\
  \ (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman\
  \ Sander M. Levin, Dean of the House John Dingell, and Appropriations Committee\
  \ Chairman Dave Obey, all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.[37] As minority\
  \ leader, Boehner served as an ex officio member of the Permanent Select Committee\
  \ on Intelligence. Speaker of the House (2011\u20132015) Speaker Boehner greets\
  \ U.S. President Barack Obama before the 2011 State of the Union Address The Republicans\
  \ won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections,\
  \ with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into\
  \ tears when talking about \"economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I\
  \ hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing\
  \ the American Dream\".[34] On November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen\
  \ by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker,[38][39] all but assuring\
  \ his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican\
  \ majority in January 2011. He received the gavel from outgoing Speaker Pelosi on\
  \ Wednesday, January 5, 2011.[40] He was the first Speaker from Ohio since fellow\
  \ Republicans Nicholas Longworth (1925 to 1931) and J. Warren Keifer (1881 to 1883).\
  \ He was also the first Speaker who has served both as majority and minority floor\
  \ leader for his party since Texas Democrat Sam Rayburn.[citation needed] Speaker\
  \ Boehner meets with Pope Francis during his visit to the United States Congress\
  \ As Speaker, he was still the leader of the House Republicans. However, by tradition,\
  \ he normally did not take part in debate, although he had the right to do so, and\
  \ rarely voted from the floor.[41] He was not a member of any House committees during\
  \ his Speakership. Boehner was narrowly re-elected as Speaker of the House on January\
  \ 3, 2013, at the beginning of the 113th United States Congress.[42] He received\
  \ 220 votes, needing 214 to win.[43] In July 2014, Boehner moved forward on a lawsuit\
  \ to force the President to impose penalties on companies who failed to provide\
  \ healthcare coverage for their employees.[44] Boehner had pressed for legislation\
  \ to delay this mandate the previous year.[45] The third law firm selected finally\
  \ filed the suit in November 2014, after Boehner criticized Obama's unilateral moves\
  \ on immigration policy.[46] Resignation See also: October 2015 Speaker of the United\
  \ States House of Representatives election Speaker Boehner looks at the National\
  \ Mall from the Speaker's balcony at the U.S. Capitol for one final time before\
  \ leaving office On September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down\
  \ as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation\
  \ took place after Pope Francis' address to Congress the day before, an event considered\
  \ by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources\
  \ in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord\
  \ while trying to manage the passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government.\
  \ Conservative opposition to funding Planned Parenthood as part of the resolution,\
  \ and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted\
  \ the resignation.[47] Originally, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California\
  \ had intended to run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite. On October\
  \ 8, 2015, McCarthy abruptly rescinded his candidacy, citing that he felt he could\
  \ not effectively lead a fractured Republican Conference. After McCarthy's announcement,\
  \ Boehner stayed on as Speaker until a successor was chosen.[48] After initially\
  \ turning down requests from Republican leaders, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Ways\
  \ and Means Committee chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, ran\
  \ for Speaker with Boehner's blessing.[49] On October 29, 2015, in his final act\
  \ as Speaker, Boehner presided over Ryan's election.[50] Boehner's resignation from\
  \ Congress became official on October 31, 2015, at 11:59\_p.m.[51] Controversies\
  \ This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section may compromise the article's\
  \ neutrality. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections\
  \ through discussion on the talk page. (June 2015) Connections to lobbyists In June\
  \ 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from tobacco industry lobbyists\
  \ on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.[52]\
  \ In a 1996 documentary by PBS called The People and the Power Game, Boehner said\
  \ \"They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end\
  \ of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret.\
  \ I should not have done so. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a\
  \ practice that's gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know\
  \ I'll never do it again.\"[53] Boehner eventually led the effort to change House\
  \ rules and prohibit campaign contributions from being distributed on the House\
  \ floor.[54] A September 2010 story in The New York Times said Boehner was \"Tightly\
  \ Bound to Lobbyists\" and that \"He maintains especially tight ties with a circle\
  \ of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest businesses,\
  \ including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.\"\
  .[55] Smithsonian In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor,\
  \ called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the Smithsonian's National Portrait\
  \ Gallery after he learned that it featured a video by David Wojnarowicz, A Fire\
  \ in My Belly, that contained an image of a crucifix with ants crawling on it. Boehner\
  \ spokesman Kevin Smith said, \"Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge\
  \ the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in\
  \ January when the new majority in the House moves [in].\"[56] Hurricane Sandy relief\
  \ bill On January 1, 2013, after passing the fiscal cliff deal, Boehner adjourned\
  \ the House without passing the $60 million Hurricane Sandy relief bill. Some Representatives,\
  \ especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats,\
  \ and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie harshly criticized Boehner.[57] Boehner\
  \ later promised to pass the bill.[58] Challenged 2015 House Chair election Many\
  \ Republicans were ready for a new House of Representatives Chairman following the\
  \ 2014 mid-term elections. EMC Research reported 60% of participants in their telephone\
  \ survey wanted a new chairman.[59] In the end there were a total of 25 votes against\
  \ Boehner; 29 were needed in order to choose a new speaker. Boehner responded by\
  \ removing those who opposed him from influential committees.[60] Political positions\
  \ Boehner introducing then-president George W. Bush in Troy, Ohio in 2003 Boehner\
  \ speaking at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference A profile in the\
  \ Pittsburgh Tribune-Review said, \"On both sides of the aisle, Boehner earns praise\
  \ for candor and an ability to listen.\"[61] The Plain Dealer says Boehner \"has\
  \ perfected the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable.\"[62] Boehner has\
  \ been classified as a \"hard-core conservative\" by OnTheIssues.[63] Although Boehner\
  \ has a conservative voting record when he was running for House leadership, religious\
  \ conservatives in the GOP expressed that they were not satisfied with his positions.\
  \ According to The Washington Post: \"From illegal immigration to sanctions on China\
  \ to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee\
  \ on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were\
  \ contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives \u2013 examining\
  \ his voting record \u2013 see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic\
  \ concerns, not theirs.\"[64] Boehner opposes same-sex marriage, as evidenced by\
  \ his vote for the Federal Marriage Amendment in both 2004 and 2006. In a letter\
  \ to the Human Rights Campaign, Boehner stated, \"I oppose any legislation that\
  \ would provide special rights for homosexuals... Please be assured that I will\
  \ continue to work to protect the idea of the traditional family as one of the fundamental\
  \ tenets of western civilization.\"[65][66] On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement\
  \ defending his agenda and attacking his \"Democrat friends\" such as Minority Leader\
  \ Nancy Pelosi. Boehner said regarding national security that voters \"have a choice\
  \ between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory\
  \ and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly\
  \ dismisses the challenges of a post-9/11 world and is all too willing to concede\
  \ defeat on the battlefield in Iraq.\" Boehner is a signer of Americans for Tax\
  \ Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge.[67] In June 2013, Boehner labeled former\
  \ NSA contractor Edward Snowden a traitor after his leaks went public.[68] \"I'm\
  \ not qualified to debate the science over climate change\", Boehner said at a press\
  \ conference on May 29, 2014, at which he criticized proposed federal regulations\
  \ on coal-fired power plants.[69][70][71] In 2011, Boehner opposed the NATO-led\
  \ military intervention in Libya.[72] In 2015, Boehner supported the Saudi Arabian-led\
  \ intervention in Yemen, saying: \"I applaud the Saudis for taking this action to\
  \ protect their homeland and to protect their neighborhood.\"[73] Financial crisis\
  \ Speaker Boehner meets with President Obama at the White House during the 2011\
  \ debt ceiling increase negotiations On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner\
  \ attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary\
  \ Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and was urged to craft\
  \ legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective\
  \ the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.[74] On\
  \ October 3, 2008, Boehner voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP),[75]\
  \ believing that the enumerated powers grant Congress the authority to \"purchase\
  \ assets and equity from financial institutions to strengthen its financial sector.\"\
  \ Boehner had been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress\
  \ and President Barack Obama, including the \"cap and trade\" plan that Boehner\
  \ said would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed\
  \ the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and said that, if Republicans took\
  \ control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever\
  \ it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect\
  \ of the Act, not paying \"one dime\" of the salaries of the workers who would administer\
  \ the plan.[76] He also led opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first\
  \ budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan[77] and\
  \ a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI).[78] He advocated\
  \ for an across-the-board spending freeze, including entitlement programs. Boehner\
  \ favored making changes in Social Security, such as by raising the retirement age\
  \ to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, as well as tying\
  \ cost-of-living increases to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation,\
  \ and limiting payments to those who need them.[76] In 2011, Boehner called the\
  \ No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act \"one of our highest legislative priorities.\"\
  [79][80] In 2013, Boehner led his caucus in a strategy to freeze Defense spending\
  \ in order to avoid reducing the deficit with revenue increases.[81] As Republican\
  \ House Leader, Boehner was a Democratic target for criticism of Republican views\
  \ and political positions. In July 2010, President Barack Obama began singling out\
  \ Boehner for criticism during his speeches.[82] In one speech, Obama mentioned\
  \ Boehner's name nine times,[83] and accused him of believing that police, firefighters,\
  \ and teachers were jobs \"not worth saving\".[84] Later career Politics Boehner\
  \ made headlines in April 2016 when he referred to Republican presidential candidate\
  \ Ted Cruz as \"Lucifer in the flesh\" in an interview at Stanford University.[85]\
  \ On May 12, after Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, Boehner's\
  \ support for him (while distancing himself from Trump on several policies) became\
  \ public; he also expressed satisfaction with Cruz not securing the nomination:\
  \ \"Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win.\"[86] On February 23, 2017, Boehner\
  \ predicted Republicans would \"fix\" the Affordable Care Act and give it a different\
  \ name as opposed to their stated intent to repeal and replace.[87] On August 17,\
  \ 2020, a spokesperson for Boehner stated that he would not endorse either President\
  \ Trump or Joe Biden for the 2020 United States presidential election, saying: \"\
  The answer is no. I think he'd rather set himself on fire than get involved in the\
  \ election. Nothing to see here.\"[88] Despite his critiques, Boehner confirmed\
  \ he voted for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Explaining his vote, he\
  \ said: \"At the end of the day, who gets nominated to the federal courts is the\
  \ most important thing a President does.\"[89] After the January 6 United States\
  \ Capitol attack, Boehner called on Republicans to \"awaken\", saying: \"The invasion\
  \ of our Capitol by a mob, incited by lies from some entrusted with power, is a\
  \ disgrace to all who sacrificed to build our Republic.\"[90] Boehner later congratulated\
  \ Biden on his victory after the vote was certified.[90] He has frequently reiterated\
  \ his feelings, on one account noting how Trump \"Incited That Bloody Insurrection\"\
  ,[91] and called Ted Cruz \"a reckless asshole who thinks he is smarter than everyone\
  \ else\".[92] Boehner said that Trump should \"consider resigning\" and that President\
  \ Trump had \"violated his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution\
  \ of the United States.\"[93] Boehner continued to express his disdain for Trump\
  \ through 2023, where he stated his belief that the GOP needs to \"move on\" from\
  \ Trump during a June interview with CBS News.[94] Boehner's political memoir, titled\
  \ On the House: A Washington Memoir, was published by St. Martin's Press on April\
  \ 13, 2021. Excerpts began appearing early in April.[95] In this memoir, he lambasts\
  \ Cruz, Michele Bachmann, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Trump. It also covers\
  \ how the Tea Party movement, which forced him into retirement, later morphed into\
  \ Trumpism.[96] In response to the criticism he received in the book, Cruz threatened\
  \ to burn Boehner's book if his supporters could fulfil his \u201C72-hour drive\
  \ to raise $250,000\u201D in campaign funds.[97] Despite his resignation from politics,\
  \ during the October 2023 Speaker of the House election following the removal of\
  \ Kevin McCarthy, Boehner received one vote to reprise his role as Speaker of the\
  \ United States House of Representatives.[98] Business Boehner joined the board\
  \ of tobacco company Reynolds American on September 15, 2016.[99] In 2018, Boehner\
  \ joined the board of Acreage Holdings, a cannabis corporation, to promote the medical\
  \ use of cannabis and advocate for federal de-scheduling of the drug (a shift from\
  \ his previous stance while in Congress).[100] In 2019, Boehner was named chair\
  \ of the National Cannabis Roundtable, a cannabis lobbying organization.[101] Legacy\
  \ In reporting his pending retirement, Politico summarized his Speakership: Boehner\
  \ came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement\
  \ that gave him constant problems. He clashed with social conservatives over the\
  \ debt limit, government funding, Obamacare[102] and taxes. But his tenure will\
  \ also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama.\
  \ He and Obama tried\_\u2013 but repeatedly failed\_\u2013 to cut a deal on a sweeping\
  \ fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the\
  \ trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.[103]\
  \ Paul Kane in The Washington Post emphasizes how none of the \"big deals\" he sought\
  \ were ever reached: Boehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the\
  \ $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged\
  \ version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.[104]\
  \ Furthermore, Kane argues, Boehner's persona alienated conservative Republicans\
  \ who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, \"a country\
  \ club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward\
  \ while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or\
  \ cable TV, Boehner's easygoing style did not fit.\"[104] Personal life Boehner\
  \ and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and lived in the Wetherington section\
  \ of West Chester Township, Ohio. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.[105]\
  \ Boehner has been known to be emotional and cry during noteworthy events.[106][107]\
  \ On May 15, 2016, Boehner was awarded the Laetare Medal, considered the highest\
  \ honor for American Catholics, by the University of Notre Dame. The medal was awarded\
  \ to Joe Biden at the same time.[108][109] Publications Boehner, John (2021). On\
