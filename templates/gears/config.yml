  \ a memorable quote from the 2005 animated comedy film Family Guy Presents: Stewie\
  \ Griffin: The Untold Story.[1] On the web, the expression is used to preface an\
  \ airing of grievances in an advice animal image macro series featuring Family Guy\
  \ protagonist Peter Griffin. Origin While the phrase has been used as an English\
  \ idiom to introduce one's pet peeve since as early as 1987 in the comedy film Planes,\
  \ Trains & Automobiles,[13] its online popularity can be largely attributed to a\
  \ gag featured in the 2005 direct-to-DVD animated film Family Guy Presents Stewie\
  \ Griffin: The Untold Story. In the film, Peter Griffin hosts a local access news\
  \ program titled \u201CYou Know What Really Grinds My Gears,\u201D in which he complains\
  \ about things and people that irk him, including Lindsay Lohan, people who lived\
  \ in the 19th century, and the lack of new jokes about priests and rabbis. The gag\
  \ is a parody of the 1976 satirical film Network[2] that follows the story of a\
  \ newscaster whose on-air rant causes ratings to skyrocket and ultimately save his\
  \ job. Spread As early as December 16th, 2005, complaint threads titled \"What really\
  \ grinds your gears?\" began appearing on message boards including HeroClix Realms[4]\
  \ and Xbox 360 Achievements.[5] In October 2007, a blogger named Gracie created\
  \ You Know What Really Grinds My Gears?[6] (shown below, left), a personal blog\
  \ journaling her pet peeves and other problems. In March 2008, another blog named\
  \ This Is What Really Grinds My Gears[7](shown below, right) was launched, showcasing\
  \ frustrations and personal problems submitted by the readers. On June 25th, 2011,\
  \ a Meme Generator[9] page was created for \u201CGrinds My Gears Peter Griffin,\u201D\
  \ using a still image of Griffin seated at a desk from the local access show scene\
  \ in the movie. One of the first instances to be submitted to the /r/AdviceAnimals\
  \ subreddit[14] was posted on August 23rd, 2012, suggesting that the poster was\
  \ irked that the image macro series was not already established (shown below, left).\
  \ Although a number of additional instances continued to appear throughout the rest\
  \ of 2012, the advice animal character did not make the front page until May 15th,\
  \ 2013,[15] paired with a complaint about people using images of mechanical gears\
  \ that do not fit together with the expression (shown above, right). Notable Examples\
  \ As of June 2013, there are more than 3,100 submissions of Grinds My Gears Peter\
  \ Griffin on Meme Generator, with an additional 70 instances on Quickmeme.[10] Additional\
