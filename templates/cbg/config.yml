  \ Book Guy smiling Comic Book Guy is an obese and socially incompetent man who is\
  \ perhaps best known for his sarcastic quips. He holds a master's degree in folklore\
  \ and mythology (he translated The Lord of the Rings into Klingon as part of his\
  \ thesis).[5] He exhibits geeky behavior to an extraordinary and deliberately unrealistic\
  \ degree, and often also makes references to obscure subjects or internet culture.\
  \ His catchphrase is the declaration, \"Worst... (subject)... ever\". He states\
  \ that he is a 45 year-old virgin who lives with his parents.[6] Comic Book Guy\
  \ is extremely obese, to the point where his clothes barely fit over his huge stomach.\
  \ He also at one point suffered from lumbago. Appropriate to his nickname, Comic\
  \ Book Guy is obsessed with comic books, pop culture, and science fiction. Comic\
  \ Book Guy has a bumper sticker that reads \"My Other Car Is The Millennium Falcon,\"\
  \ given to him by a Harrison Ford lookalike. The license plate on his AMC Gremlin\
  \ is NCC-1701, the registry number of Star Trek's USS Enterprise. The contents of\
  \ his display case include, among other oddities, a photo of Sean Connery signed\
  \ by Roger Moore and a very rare Mary Worth in which she advised a friend to commit\
  \ suicide. He also owns a T-shirt that says \"C:/DOS C:/DOS/RUN RUN/DOS/RUN\" (Notice\
  \ the incorrect usage of the forward slash. DOS directories are listed with a backslash,\
  \ so it would be \"C:\\DOS C:\\DOS\\RUN RUN\\DOS\\RUN\"). He is a member of Springfield's\
  \ chapter of Mensa, along with Principal Skinner, Dr. Hibbert, Lisa Simpson, Professor\
  \ Frink, and Lindsey Naegle. In the episode \"Beware My Cheating Bart\", he says\
  \ he is a cyber bully. In the episode \"Large Marge\", Comic Book Guy had liposuction\
  \ performed on him, so he would fit in a Superman costume. Likewise, he once applied\
  \ several corsets onto himself so he'd look like Captain Kirk from Star Trek: The\
  \ Original Series, although his girth was such that he ultimately couldn't contain\
  \ his obesity anymore and ended up destroying his corsets in such a gradual manner\
  \ that he ended up referencing the levels of weight gain by Kirk's actor William\
  \ Shatner regarding various Star Trek roles he did, before grudgingly stating he\
  \ was now at Boston Legal-levels. He also extensively modified what was originally\
  \ Randall Curtis's outfit when about to see Cosmic Wars: The Gathering Shadow, including\
  \ adding pregnancy pads in order to have it sufficiently adapt to his \"more unique\
  \ body type.\" Personality[] Comic Book Guy Comic Book Guy is a middle-aged, obese,\
  \ almost fanatical comic buff and displays deep passion regarding all fictional\
  \ memorabilia in general, especially science fiction to the point of complete monomania.\
  \ Sarcastic, irate and proudly geeky, Comic Book Guy does not treat anyone with\
  \ kindness unless they are as passionate about comics as he is. Most of the character's\
  \ infamy and trademarks are derived from his constant sarcastic observations, quips\
  \ and distinct accent. Comic Book Guy's Obsessive-Compulsive fixation with comics\
  \ is such that when somebody placed a Spider-Man comic inside The Spectacular Spider-Man\
  \ slot, it was enough to make him angry. He is so stressed about people's comic\
  \ book ignorance around him that it caused him to have a heart attack, while Dr.\
  \ Hibbert later calls his profession as owner of a comic book store one of the most\
  \ stressful jobs in the world, referring to it as the \"widow-maker\" (if any [comic\
  \ book store owners] had wives). Aside from following Radioactive Man, the ongoing\
  \ Hollywood movies and fast-paced internet nudity, Comic Book Guy is also a fan\
  \ of Marvel and DC Comics such as Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, Fantastic Four,\
  \ Hulk and many more. He also enjoys Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Star Trek,\
  \ Game of Thrones, and Japanese anime. Comic Book Guy owns, amongst his vast collectibles,\
  \ a Hulk melon baller (which he originally intended as a wedding gift to Skinner\
  \ and Krabappel), costumes of Spider-Man, The Flash, Batman, Spock, and a Klingon\
  \ Warrior, several life-sized cardboard cut-outs of various Star Wars characters,\
  \ Star Wars sheets, and a Jar-Jar Binks figure which he sleeps with. Comic Book\
  \ Guy speaks fluent Klingon, Mordor Black Speech, has set his life on routine of\
  \ the Vulcan mating ritual Pon Farr, has a restraining order on Lynda Carter, and\
  \ has a crush on Star Trek actress Nichelle Nichols, Batman's Catwoman, and Get\
  \ Smart's Agent 99. Comic Book Guy's catchphrase Aside from his more onerous personality\
  \ traits, Comic Book Guy is also prone to doing illegal behavior. Comic Book Guy\
  \ has a massive collection of bootlegs of stolen movies, police interrogations and\
  \ even ones regarding homeland security in his basement. This once got him arrested\
  \ by the Springfield Police Department after his stash had somehow leaked to them.\
  \ Likewise, he also attempted to illegally report on a test showing of the Mel Gibson\
  \ remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington via a desktop computer, only for him to\
  \ somehow get caught and thrown out of the Aztec Theater as well as having his computer\
  \ junked by them (as well as expressing irritation at them neglecting to return\
  \ the mouse to him until they promptly toss it back to them before politely thanking\
  \ them). Comic Book Guy has a habit of stating his emotions and what is occurring\
  \ or how he is feeling as it happens. When he was having a heart attack, he yelled\
  \ out the symptoms; \"breath short, left arm numb\" before he collapsed and yelled\
  \ \"can't go on describing symptoms any longer\". Comic Book Guy often states what\
  \ he thinks in a matter-of-factual way, such as the method listing \"A, B\" and\
  \ using words like \"correction\" or \"false\" whenever he corrects somebody. In\
  \ addition, Comic Book Guy refers to comic books as if they were actuality, for\
  \ example when Stan Lee entered the Android's Dungeon, he proclaims \"my heart is\
  \ pounding like Thor's hammer against Doctor Doom's titanium breastplate\". He has\
  \ shown to be one of the few characters who non-directly break the fourth wall in\
  \ his canon appearances. For example, in season 11, when Marge asks if the Simpsons\
  \ should get a horse when Bart wanted to adopt Duncan, Comic Book Guy noted that\
  \ the Simpsons already had a horse in season 3 (even though he was not involved\
  \ in that situation and didn't appear in that episode at all). Comic Book Guy treats\
  \ most of his patrons cruelly and usually extorts his customers out of expensive\
  \ collectibles or tricks them altogether into buying something. For example, claiming\
  \ to Milhouse, who desperately needed it, that the bathroom was only for paying\
  \ customers tricks him into buying a comic before allowing him to be taken away\
  \ by his father, paying five dollars for priceless unseen Star Wars memorabilia\
  \ and selling Fantastic Floors under Fantastic Four. Comic Book Guy is quite bitter,\
  \ keeping a banned list of Milhouse, Bart (with those two being banned solely because\
  \ they stopped Martha Price from unknowingly selling the aforementioned priceless\
  \ unseen Star Wars memorabilia), Sideshow Bob, Nelson and Matt Groening in his store\
  \ (although the first two he lifted the ban on after they saved his life upon having\
  \ a heart attack), and after being made a fool of by Tom Savini during the latter's\
  \ comic act, just prior to his heart attack, he angrily declared all the audience\
  \ to be banned from his store for laughing at him. Once, he insulted Duff Beer in\
  \ front of the patrons at Moe's Tavern while recovering from the aforementioned\
  \ heart attack by calling it the \"nectar of the nitwit\", which resulted in him\
  \ being thrown out of the bar (as well as Lenny attempting to partly break the Duff\
  \ Beer bottle he had with the intention of stabbing Comic Book Guy with it as revenge,\
  \ only to accidentally shatter the entire bottle). Although he lives a solitary\
  \ lifestyle and his lack of social skills prevent him from ever making headway in\
  \ a relationship with a woman until meeting his future wife Kumiko, Comic Book Guy\
  \ proclaims before his near-certain death that a life of collecting comics and other\
  \ fictions was a \"life well spent'. Although onerous, he has had some positive\
  \ elements to him. For one thing, he willingly allowed Marge Simpson to access his\
  \ recording of Abe's breakdown at church so she could transcribe what exactly Abe\
  \ said, in exchange for Homer's long pajamas, and even attempted to aid Marge in\
  \ figuring out what Grampa meant by \"Epa! Epa!\" to the best of his ability. He\
  \ even assisted Homer and a group they both joined in finding the zoo\u2019s missing\
  \ tortoise, and in another instance, he attempted to give Ned Flanders a good luck\
  \ prayer in Klingon before Ned went to confront Fit-Fat Tony. Comic Book Guy with\
  \ Stan Lee. Early life[] According to \"Three Men and a Comic Book\", he at some\
  \ point got a Master's degree in folklore and mythology. According to \"Married\
  \ to the Blob\", he also received a degree in chemical engineering. Comic Book Guy\
  \ lived in his parents' basement in the 1980s. He had a dog named Chewbacca (now\
  \ deceased). He also went to a fat camp, which, judging by his current appearance,\
  \ was unsuccessful.[7]He was Moe Szyslak's [1] first kiss. In the episode \"The\
  \ Dad-Feelings Limited\", it was revealed that Comic Book Guy's childhood was really\
  \ troubled, with his family and father not paying any attention to him and paying\
  \ that attention to their choice collectibles. Another highlight of Comic Book Guy's\
  \ life is that he enjoyed playing baseball when he was young. He was so interested\
  \ in baseball that he perfected a curveball. But during an important ball game,\
  \ his father failed to show up, ruining his game. His teammates proceeded to throw\
  \ him into a dumpster, which would be filled with leftover garbage comics. Those\
  \ comics would lead him to become the nerd we all know and some hate. Later it was\
  \ revealed that his father was gone getting CBG a baseball autographed by Sandy\
  \ Koufax. That autographed baseball would mend their relationship and allow CBG\
  \ the comfort to have a child with his wife Kumiko. The Android's Dungeon and Baseball\
  \ Card Shop[] Comic Book Guy is the owner of The Android's Dungeon and Baseball\
  \ Card Shop, a local comic book store. Many of the comics and toys he sells are\
  \ of very poor-quality, and often sell for very high prices. His store is his sanctuary,\
  \ where he holds some level of self-esteem, imperiously lording over pre-teen kids,\
  \ like Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, using a heavily sarcastic tone. When\
  \ he was the target of mockery while trying to return the Ultimate Belt, he sighed,\
  \ \"I must get back to my comic book store, where I dispense the insults rather\
  \ than absorb them\". His store contains a section full of illegal videos, which\
  \ include Mr. Rogers drunk, Alien Autopsy, Illegal Alien Autopsy, a top secret American\
  \ nuclear war strategy session, a \"good version\" of The Godfather Part III, Kent\
  \ Brockman picking his nose, and Ned Flanders in a police informant video, wherein\
  \ he claims that Homer released a radioactive ape in his house (although, according\
  \ to Bart, Homer only let the ape into the house because the ape tricked Homer,\
  \ and\_not out of malicious intent). He later was arrested and had his store shut\
  \ down temporarily because of this. He once had to give up the Ultimate Belt (which\
  \ he won as a door prize at a Star Trek Convention) because, as he pointed out,\
  \ \"the average Trekker has no use for a medium-sized belt\". Comic Book Guy's store\
  \ Unemployment[] At a small point in the episode \"Husbands and Knives\", due to\
  \ a better comic book store opening across the street, it caused Comic Book Guy\
  \ to go out of business, getting him to stoop to selling pretentious martial arts\
  \ merchandise to children, but soon backfired after also having attempted to assassinate\
  \ his competitor with his weapons. After that, Comic Book Guy was forced to close\
  \ down his comic book store and became unemployed (which his place later turned\
  \ into a females orientated gym). It's unclear how Comic Book Guy got his comic\
  \ book store back as future episodes shows The Android's Dungeon again.[8] It is\
  \ implied that Marge closed down her gym and gave Comic Book Guy his store back\
  \ again. Similar stores[] In North Haverbrook, there is a comic book shop named\
  \ \"Mylar Baggins\" and the proprietor bears a striking resemblance to Comic Book\
  \ Guy with the exception that his skin and hair are slightly darker. He also has\
  \ a deep-rooted rivalry with a store similar to his: \"Frodo's of Shelbyville\"\
  . However, in \"Homer the Whopper\", the owners of the various rival comic book\
  \ stores (Mylar Baggins, Odin's of Shelbyville, and The Maltese Vulcan) all look\
  \ different and Frodo's has apparently changed to \"Odin's of Shelbyville\". During\
  \ the Trappuccino crisis, Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting\
  \ is a \"life well spent\".[9] In the episode \"Husband and Knives\" a bigger and\
  \ better comic book store by the name of \"Coolsville Comics & Toys\" is placed\
  \ right across the street from The Androids Dungeon. The store is run by a man named\
  \ Milo, who is the exact opposite of Comic Book Guy. Brief Fame[] In \"Homer the\
  \ Whopper\", Comic Book Guy created the comic book series Everyman. He apparently\
  \ created 278 issues, including the controversial issue with the death of Marmaduke.\
  \ However, he was reluctant to self-publish them initially because he feared that\
  \ he'd be mocked by the internet community for his comics. While trying to exasperate\
  \ Comic Book Guy by feigning complete ignorance on the history of Spiderman, Bart\
  \ and Milhouse stumbled upon a draft of an issue of Everyman that he was working\
  \ on. Comic Book Guy then learned that Bart and Milhouse actually liked the comic,\
  \ and after a bit of convincing, he decided to self-publish. The comic's popularity\
  \ started to soar as a result, with a movie project starting for the Summer Market.\
  \ Some movie executives requested to make Everyman into a movie. Comic Book Guy\
  \ was reluctant to allow them to work with the movie, especially as the same movie\
  \ company apparently ruined the Stratego movie for him. He eventually relented,\
  \ but only under the condition that he picked the person who will portray Everyman.\
  \ When they refused that condition, he opened the door to the store, implying that\
  \ he wanted them to leave, until they agreed to that condition, commenting that\
  \ being \"hard-balled by Hollywood\" is the closest thing to a physical sport that\
  \ he could ever do. He later explains that he wants a \"complete loser\" to portray\
  \ Everyman. He then picks Homer Simpson for the part, after the latter accidentally\
  \ walked into the store, not realizing it was closed for auditioning. He then spent\
  \ his time talking to people at his new, Hollywood-style house about what it is\
  \ like to be a producer, and adopting a Cambodian Orphan named Prius. However, when\
  \ the movie was going over budget and Homer ended up gaining an eating disorder\
  \ due to his fitness coach abandoning him for Turtle (to the extent that he couldn't\
  \ even get out of his trailer without it being sawed off), he tried to end production\
  \ of the film, but ended up being thrown out by security into a dumpster with disgraced\
  \ executives. He later ended up sacrificing any chance at another Everyman movie\
  \ being made by voicing his honest opinion that the Everyman movie was the worst\
  \ movie ever. It is unknown if he still worked on his comics after this. Relationships[]\
  \ Comic Book Guy was once married\u2014in an online role-playing game. He and his\
  \ Internet wife contemplated having children, but that would have severely drained\
  \ his power crystals. He was shown paired with Mindy Simmons, the woman who had\
  \ briefly tempted Homer, during a mass-marriage that occurred when a cult took over\
  \ Springfield, and presumably the two were wed in the mass ceremony.[10] While part\
  \ of an intellectual junta that briefly ran Springfield, he proposed plans to limit\
  \ breeding to once every seven years (a reference to the Vulcan blood fever of mating,\
  \ called Pon Farr), commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most,\
  \ but for him, \"much, much more\". Comic Book Guy also has a cousin named Comic\
  \ Book Gay, who is mustachioed and presumably homosexual. Comic Book Gay is interested\
  \ in \"certain types of comics\" and sounds just like Comic Book Guy. Comic Book\
  \ Guy with Agnes Skinner Agnes Skinner[] He was a virgin well into his forties when\
  \ he became romantically involved with Principal Skinner's mother Agnes. Chief Wiggum\
  \ and Eddie were notably repulsed when he and his officers stumbled upon the couple\
  \ \"in the act,\" (having sex) with the former even quickly offering when arresting\
  \ him for pirated videos that he'll reduce his sentence if he \"puts on some pants,\
  \ fast!\" Edna Krabappel[] He later dated Edna Krabappel[11] and was shown with\
  \ the Superman logo tattooed on his upper right buttock (which is interesting, as\
  \ in the Comic Book Guy's Book of Pop Culture, he states that he hates Superman;\
  \ it's possible that considering the location he doesn't consider this to be a compliment).\
  \ Comic Book Girl[] While at the Springfield Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con, Comic Book Guy meets\
  \ a woman to whom he is attracted and asks, \"How do you feel about forty-five year\
  \ old virgins who still live with their parents?\" However, this relationship does\
  \ not progress any further when he refuses to comb the Sweet Tarts out of his beard.\
  \ Kumiko[] In the episode \"Married to the Blob\", he met and started dating Kumiko\
  \ Nakamura, a Japanese mangaka. He later married her. In Season 32's \"The Dad-Feelings\
  \ Limited\", Kumiko and him had been arguing on whether to have a baby or not. At\
  \ the end of the episode they had decided to have a baby. However, Comic Book Guy\
  \ has been shown many times since this scene and there has been no mention of a\
  \ child. Non-Canon Appearances[] The contents of this article or section are considered\

  \ commentary during the end-game credits, where he, predictably, makes scathing\
  \ comments about the people who worked on the game. The Simpsons Hit and Run[] Comic\
  \ Book Guy appears in a few missions. He first appears in the third mission of the\
  \ second level, \"Vox Nerduli\" Bart asks him if he knows where Bart can get a copy\
  \ of Bonestorm 2 but Comic Book Guy is more interested in being the first to register\
  \ his complaint about the the new McBain film. (According to him the action was\
  \ dismal and the nudity was frustratingly fleeting), however after Comic Book Guy\
  \ and Bart race against a nerd to get to The Java Server, Comic Book Guy tells Bart\
  \ that Professor Frink has purchased all the remaining copies of Bonestorm 2. He\
  \ next appears in the first mission of the third level, \"Nerd Race Queen.\" Lisa,\
  \ trying to find Bart, tries to ask whether he had seen him. Comic Book Guy, however,\
  \ is unwilling to answer her question, as he's more concerned with trying to get\
  \ the last issue of the Itchy & Scratchy Adventures comic (which, according to him,\
  \ is a very controversial issue as the two finally kiss), and promises that he'll\
  \ aid her in her dilemma if she can assist him. After getting it, Lisa asks whether\
  \ he can tell her Bart's location now, but he insists that they return to the The\
  \ Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop in order to put the issue in a mylar bag\
  \ before it \"deteriorates into near-mint condition.\" Upon doing so, she then pressed\
  \ the issue further, with Comic Book Guy then stating that he may have seen Bart\
  \ at the Noise Land Video Arcade, and then states that video games are a waste of\
  \ money, while he considers bidding $1,000 Itchy and Scratchy corn cob holders online\
  \ to be a \"terrific, terrific expense.\" He also appears as the bonus mission for\
  \ the fourth level. In it, he asks for Marge's help in retrieving his gifts to Agnes\
  \ Skinner from Springfield Elementary School due to Principal Skinner intercepting\
  \ the gifts and locking them away there, presumably in an attempt to keep them apart,\
  \ due to her refusing to go out to mock schoolchildren for this reason. He reluctantly\
  \ admits that he can't do it by himself because his obvious lack of mobility due\
  \ to his immense weight. When Marge, sympathizing with his being husky, asks for\
  \ a favor from him in return for her helping him, he enthusiastically agrees to\
  \ it. After retrieving her belongings (Two heart boxes that presumably contained\
  \ chocolate, two sets of false teeth, two sets of heart underwear, a tombstone,\
  \ and a pair of slippers), and after returning the \"laundry\", he then, after expressing\
  \ joy at hearing Agnes' sneer again, keeps his end of the bargain by supplying her\
  \ his phone number if she wants to hear his theories on how Krusty jumped the shark.\
  \ Comic Book Guy drives a Gremlin, which can be used if selected. He later appears\
  \ in the prelude to the second mission of the seventh level. When Homer meets up\
  \ with Comic Book Guy (whom he refers to as \"Smelly Sam\") and asks what's going\
  \ on, Comic Book Guy explains that the alien craft is using a tractor beam to suck\
  \ up any trespassers to their doom, while maintaining they were horrible special\
  \ effects despite it being real. Homer then asks about the black car, with Comic\
  \ Book Guy explaining that, to his certain knowledge from Sci-fi movies, it is an\
  \ advanced alien probe, and dismisses Homer since he wants to spend his last hours\
  \ on Earth doing what he does best: Complain about movies on the internet. Homer\
  \ then mutters that the gift of life was wasted on him. Comic Book Guy then advises\
  \ that Homer buy a Zombie Car, as it would protect him from the zombies, although\
  \ it comes at the cost of needing human brains to operate as a \"slight drawback\"\
  , with Homer quipping he's got \"plenty of those.\" The Simpsons' Game[] Comic Book\
  \ Guy appears throughout the game to point out various video game cliches that the\
  \ player can unlock by performing certain actions. Jeff tells Bart that the cave\
  \ near the museum is the appropriate setting for a superhero origin story. He later\
  \ thanks Bart for saving the museum. He later says that he won't lose in the eating\
  \ contest especially not to Homer. He also appears as one of the contestants in\
  \ the Duff Ultimate Eating Challenge in the level Around the World in 80 Bites,\
  \ and sadly deals with his defeat by snacking. He also berates Groundskeeper Willie\
  \ for spoofing the end of Planet of the Apes in the ending to the aforementioned\
  \ level while cleaning. He then tells Bart about The Loggers and tells Bart that\
  \ it's cool that he saved the trees but it's not like they're Ents. Later he was\
  \ playing Grand Theft Scratchy online and is defeated by Lewis. He says l that Aquaman\
  \ has prevented dolphins from attacking the pier and gets emailed by LonleyMoe15\
  \ that Lard Lad is attacking the city and expects Zombies to attack the mall but\
  \ it's aliens. He also appears in the form of a gang of sumo wrestlers (also cliched)\
  \ in Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game. One of the Comic Book Guy sumo wrestlers make\
  \ a final appearance in the Game Over level as one of the icons God uses to defeat\
  \ the Simpsons as the family destroy his Hii. The Cleveland Show[] He had a cameo\
  \ appearance in The Cleveland Show episode Hot Cocoa Bang Bang voiced by Hank Azaria,\
  \ where he simply states \"Worst cameo ever\". Treehouse of Horror series[] In the\
  \ second segment of \"Treehouse of Horror X\", Comic Book Guy, who has styled himself\
  \ as a villain called \"The Collector,\" kidnaps Lucy Lawless thinking that she\
  \ is Xena. He kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal breast plate. Lawless\
  \ goes to remove the breastplate, but when hundreds of fans raise their cameras\
  \ to photograph her breasts she stops with a statement of \"Maybe later.\" He takes\
  \ her to his lair, where he puts her in an aluminized Pet film bag for \"safekeeping\"\
  \ and imprisons her in a room of other similarly-captured celebrities such as Yasmine\
  \ Bleeth and Tom Baker. Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl burst into The Collector's\
  \ hideout, but he manages to knock Clobber Girl out with a working phaser gun that\
  \ was fired only once to prevent William Shatner from releasing another album. He\
  \ wastes all his remaining shots on Stretch Dude, who splits in half and does somersaults\
  \ to avoid the rays. The Collector hurls his empty raygun at Stretch Dude, hitting\
  \ him on the forehead and knocking him out as well. He suspends the drowsy duo over\
  \ a vat of bubbling Lucite, slowly lowering them towards certain doom and mocks\
  \ them, saying \"Goodnight, Retch Dude and Slobber Girl. Sweet screams!\" Lucy Lawless,\
  \ still in her plastic restraint, lures the Collector over by pretending to be attracted\
  \ to him. When he's close enough she grabs his lips and then attacks him with Kung\
  \ Fu moves. Stating that he fell for a \"ruse so hackneyed, it would make Stan Lee\
  \ blush!\", the Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from\
  \ Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and ignites the blades. Lucy reminds him\
  \ that he has removed it from its original packaging and it is now no longer a collectible.\
  \ He backs away in horror and plummets into the Lucite, eventually emerging to strike\
  \ a dramatic death pose (imitating a Lorne Greene pose from Battlestar Galactica)\
  \ before the plastic hardens around him. In the second segment of \"Treehouse of\
  \ Horror XIV\", Jonathan Frink Sr. takes his butt, however he somehow survives this.\
  \ In the final segment of the \"Treehouse of Horror XXIV\", he is seen as a snail\
  \ during the closing credits. In \"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\", he is listening to\
  \ Kumiko in \"Homerzilla\". \"A Serious Flanders: Part One\"[] At The Android's\
  \ Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop, Seamus and Collette pries the information on how\
  \ to find Ned, threatening him, and after learning of his usual location, Comic\
  \ Book Guy calls Fit-Fat Tony asking him why he wasn't protected like he pays for,\
  \ and Fit-Fat Tony tells him he'll deal with him. Physical Appearance[] Comic Book\
  \ Guy is morbidly obese, has a slight stubble, and has a receding hairline. His\
  \ hair is light brown and in a ponytail. He usually wears a blue short-sleeve shirt\
  \ has does not fully fit over his stomach, red shorts, and blue shoes. Behind the\
  \ Laughter[] Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles Amok\
  \ book shop who often \"[sat] on the high stool, kind of lording over the store\
  \ with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam\
  \ containerful of fried clams with a lot of tartare sauce.\" Matt Groening noted\
  \ that: \"I can't tell you how many times people have come up to me and said, 'I\
  \ know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down\
  \ the block.' And I have to tell them, \"No, it's every comic-bookstore guy in America.\"\
  \ Hank Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a student who went by the name \"\
  F\", and lived in the room next door at his college. Azaria also \"loves that the\
  \ character is an adult who argues with kids as if they're his peers.\" A long-running\
  \ gag on the show was never to reveal the character's name, with other characters\
  \ referring to him as \"Comic Book Guy\". Finally, in the February 6, 2005 episode,\
  \ \"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\", Comic Book Guy nonchalantly told Ned, \"My\
  \ name is Jeff Albertson, but everyone calls me 'Comic Book Guy'.\" Showrunner Al\
  \ Jean remarked, \"That was specifically done to make people really mad. We just\
  \ tried to pick a generic name. It was also the Super Bowl show, so we did it so\
  \ the most people possible would see it.\" Groening stated that he had originally\
  \ intended him to be called Louis Lane and be \"obsessed and tormented by\" Lois\
  \ Lane, but was out of the room when the writers named him. Comic Book Guy's Book\
  \ of Pop Culture Comic Book Guy has also been seen in quite a few episodes but he\
  \ has had very few episodes where he is a major character. He is rarely seen outside\
  \ The Android's Dungeon and most of his interactions are with Bart Simpson. Comic\
  \ Book Guy wasn't seen very often early in the series of the show and has not been\
  \ seen very much since in the 19th season. Trivia[] Comic Book Guy has an IQ of\
  \ 170. His cousin is Comic Book Gay. In The Chloe Park Show episode \"The Simpsons\
  \ Crossover\", he gives Winifred a wedgie. He is the one character on the show who\
  \ is even more obese than Chief Wiggum, appearing to weigh 500 pounds (227 kg) compared\
  \ with Wiggum's 350 pounds (159 kg). He has a degree in chemical engineering. He\
  \ is the featured character on the Season 12 DVD box set. He knows Kung-Fu, as shown\
  \ in \"Lisa the Drama Queen\". In his early appearances his voice sounds very similar\
  \ to Drederick Tatum's. Merchandising[] Even though Comic Book Guy is just a recurring\
  \ character, he still has some merchandise such as, Comic Books Guy's Book of Pop\
  \ Culture. He also appears on the cover of the twelfth season DVD, as well as having\
  \ four action figures in the World of Springfield line, one coming with the Collectors\
  \ Lair play set as the Collector, another coming with the Androids Dungeon play\
  \ set, a Toyfare exclusive Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con Comic Book Guy, and \"Worst Episode\
  \ Ever\" T-shirt Comic Book Guy. As part of Simpsons Comics, Comic Book Guy had\
  \ his own mini comic series. Gallery[] The full image gallery for Comic Book Guy\
