  \ Videos About \"All Your Base Are Belong to Us\" is a popular engrish catchphrase\
  \ that grew popular across the internet as early as in 1998. An awkward translation\
  \ of \"all of your bases are now under our control\", the quote originally appeared\
  \ in the opening dialogue of Zero Wing, a 16-bit shoot'em up game released in 1989.\
  \ Marked by poor grammar, the \"All Your Base\" phrase and the dialogue scene went\
  \ viral on popular discussion forums in 2000, spawning thousands of image macros\
  \ and flash animations featuring the slogan both on the web and in real life. Origin\
  \ The phrase and game footage used in the meme come from the 1992 port of the 1989\
  \ side-scrolling arcade shooter Zero Wing,[8] released on the SEGA Mega Drive. The\
  \ quote is from the introduction sequence of the game in which the main antagonist,\
  \ the leader of CATS appears to announce \"all your base are belong to us\" during\
  \ an exchange with the ship's captain. The first GIF of the opening sequence is\
  \ rumored to have originated on the Rage Games website in early 1998.[16] Additionally,\
  \ the website Zany Video Game Quotes[11] has been credited with popularizing the\
  \ GIF.[12][13] According to a timeline published on the site RetroGames.com,[15]\
  \ the GIF was posted on the site Zany Video Game Quotes in \"late 1998/early 1999.\"\
  \ Captain: What happen\_? Mechanic: Somebody set up us the bomb. Operator: We get\
  \ signal. Captain: What ! Operator: Main screen turn on. Captain: It's you !! CATS:\
  \ How are you gentlemen !! CATS: All your base are belong to us. CATS: You are on\
  \ the way to destruction. Captain: What you say !! CATS: You have no chance to survive\
  \ make your time. CATS: Ha ha ha ha\_\u2026 Operator: Captain !! Captain: Take off\
  \ every 'ZIG'!! Captain: You know what you doing. Captain: Move 'ZIG'. Captain:\
  \ For great justice. Spread In June 2000, Overclock.org posted their Zero Wing Dub\
  \ Project, featuring a dubbed version of the introduction with Wayne Newton's voice.\
  \ The video is among the first response videos to the phrase. On December 16th,\
  \ 2000, Tribal War Forums[14] member Bad_CRC submitted a thread titled \"All your\
  \ base are belong to us,\" featuring a quote from the opening sequence. In February\
  \ 2001, Bad_CRC released a music video for a gabber remix of the song, which was\
  \ also uploaded to Newgrounds[9] on February 16th, 2001 (shown below). In late 2000,\
  \ there was a large thread on the TribalWar forums. At this time, the trend also\
  \ hit SomethingAwful. According to Frogstar.com, the first photoshop thread began\
  \ in November 2000, obtaining over 2000 images. The thread has since been lost on\
  \ account of hacking. This thread also led to the song Invasion of the Gabber Robots,\
  \ by The Laziest Men On Mars. On February 23rd, 2001 Wired wrote an article on the\
  \ phrase. That year, mention of \"All Your Base\" appeared on various news sites,\
  \ such as the San Francisco Chronicle, The Guardian, and USA Today. In February\
  \ 2004, North Carolina State University students hacked into the local news live\
  \ broadcasting system that reports on weather-related closures and replaced it with\
  \ the phrase \"All your base are belong to us\".[5] On June 1st, 2006, Engineers\
  \ at YouTube replaced the site with a message reading \"ALL YOUR VIDEO ARE BELONG\
  \ TO US\" as they prepared to roll out new site features.[6] \"All Your Base\" also\
  \ appeared on a Chicago Fox news station, uploaded to YouTube in 2006, where Greg\
  \ Lindsay from Inside.com compared repeating the phrase to people saying \"WAZZZUP\"\
  \ in Budweiser commercials. On June 12, 2014, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors, released\
  \ a blog posting stating that they \"will not initiate patent lawsuits.\" The post\
  \ was entitled: \"All our Patent Are Belong to You\".[7] In addition to the macros\
  \ and videos, the meme also spawned a catchphrase of its own: For Great Justice.\
  \ It is mainly used as a motto to encourage someone in carrying an action right\
  \ to the end. Oh Internet describes it as: [\u2026]everyday tasks are made more\
  \ humorous by adding the suffix \"\u2026for great justice\" to a directive, invitation,\
  \ or announcement. It is generally assumed that a person using this phrase (or any\
  \ other meme) has nothing of real value to express. Several well-known video games\
  \ such as World of Warcraft and Guild wars reference the line. The line also gained\
  \ an article on the TV Tropes site. 2023 Zero Wing Rerelease On February 14th, 2023,\
  \ Bitwave Games rereleased the classic Zero Wing on Steam[17] and other platforms,\
  \ which initially drew criticism from some for not initially including the \"All\
  \ Your Base Are Belong To Us\" scene. However, the Bitwave port was actually based\
  \ on the 1989 arcade version of Zero Wing and not the Sega Genesis port, which included\
  \ the humorous translation that spawned the meme.[18] However, on February 16th,\
  \ following widespread coverage about the meme missing from the new remaster, Bitwave\
  \ Games confirmed in a tweet on its official Twitter[18] account that the scene\
  \ with CATs would be added in a patch soon, stating: Shmupers! CATs is coming to\
  \ Zero Wing but hasn\u2019t set us up the bomb yet. The iconic scene from Zero Wing,\
  \ reimagined, will be included in a free patch coming soon. Thank you all for your\
  \ patience! Then on March 2nd, 2023, Bitwave uploaded the reworked intro for Zero\
  \ Wing that included the Sega Genesis version with the \"All Your Base Are Belong\
  \ To Us\" scene to its YouTube channel, showing off a slightly redesigned CATs and\
  \ the classic catchphrase. The video accumulated over 2,000 views in less than 24\
  \ hours, as well as receiving notable praise in the comments section (seen below).\
  \ Various Examples Search Trends The rise of the All Your Base phenomenon also coincided\
  \ with the advents in image-editing software like Photoshop, assisting in establishing\
  \ Photoshopped images as a common medium for internet memes and mutations. Early\
  \ derivatives took the form of image macros and Flash animations, and later the\
  \ meme spread to YouTube videos as well. External References [1] Planet Tribes (via\
