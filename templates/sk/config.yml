  \ is an advice animal image macro series featuring a photograph of a dancing tribal\
  \ child with captions about overcoming hardships that are associated with life in\
  \ underdeveloped countries. The series can be seen as a derivative of Success Kid\
  \ and the anti-thesis of First World Problems. Origin Prior to the image's association\
  \ with Third World Success, the image has been seen on Twitter[18] as early as June\
  \ 2011 and paired with the phrase \"It's Friday, Niggas\"[16] as early as October\
  \ 14th, 2011.[17] The First World Problems image macro series started with a BuzzFeed[13]\
  \ post in March 2011 that juxtaposed stories from the First World Problems subreddit[14]\
  \ with the items in question. Later that year, a Quickmeme[15] page was created\
  \ featuring a stock photo of a woman crying. As of March 2012, the page has over\
  \ 91,000 instances. Terminology The Third World[24] is a term coined in 1952 by\
  \ French anthropologist Alfred Sauvy to define countries that did not take part\
  \ in either capitalism (the First World) or communism (the Second World). Over the\
  \ years, it gradually gained a negative connotation, being associated with poverty\
  \ and a country being underdeveloped.[25] In contrast, the phrase First World[26]\
  \ is associated with already developed countries. First World Problems are meant\
  \ to criticize the fact that people who live in countries considered the First World\
  \ will probably not have to encounter problems their Third World counterparts will:\
  \ not owning a computer, starvation, and combat.[27] Spread On November 11th, 2011,\
  \ Slacktory published a compilation of photos entitled \"Third World Perks: A Photo\
  \ Meme\"[8] as a alternative to First World Problems. The images consisted of people\
  \ living in impoverished conditions accompanied by optimistic captions. Approximately\
  \ two and a half weeks later on November 27th, the first Third World Success image\
  \ macro was created on Quickmeme[1], featuring a photo of a group of dancing children\
  \ with the caption \"Found water / wasn't contaminated.\" It was subsequently posted\
  \ to Reddit[12] by user somename2222 and accumulated over 12,000 up votes within\
  \ 4 days. On November 28th, the viral content site BuzzFeed[4] posted a round-up\
  \ of instances titled \"The Third World Success Kid Meme.\" Within 24 hours, there\
  \ were 230 Reddit threads related to the meme and 972 Quickmeme[3] submissions.\
  \ On November 29th, the culture blog Molempire published another compilation of\
  \ derivatives. The meme has since spread to Tumblr[5], the Body Building forums[6]\
  \ and Meme Generator.[11] As of March 2012, there are over 8000 instances on Quickmeme\
  \ and over 630 on Reddit.[19] AT&T President Lawsuit On April 27th, 2015, gossip\
  \ news site TMZ reported[33] that Aaron Slator, President of Content and Ad Sales\
  \ for the American multinational telecom corporation AT&T (shown below, left), is\
  \ facing a $100 million racial discrimination lawsuit filed by Knoyme King, a former\
  \ employee of the company who worked under Slator as a content coordinator. According\
  \ to the lawsuit, King claims that Slator had sent a text message to a friend that\
  \ featured a racially insensitive instance of the meme (shown below, right), which\
  \ also happens to be the earliest known version in the series, along with the note\
  \ \"an oldie but goodie.\" The message in question was initially discovered by one\
  \ of King's colleagues and former assistance for Slator while transferring his data\
  \ from an old cell phone to a new one. King also claims that she was treated unfairly\
  \ and harassed by Slator for being a close acquaintance of his former assistant\
  \ who discovered the message and that other executives at AT&T were informed about\
  \ the incident but took no actions to reprimand Slator. The suit also accuses the\
  \ company of maintaining a racially prejudiced culture, as King alleges she was\
  \ repeatedly held back for promotions in favor of less qualified non-African American\
  \ employees. That same day, an AT&T spokesperson issued a response condemning the\
  \ action of Slator, who has played a vital role for the company in the merging and\
  \ acquisition of DirecTV, calling the images \"offensive to everyone at AT&T\" and\
  \ assuring that \"a thorough investigation\" has been launched to determine the\
  \ appropriate course of disciplinary action. On the following day, AT&T released\
  \ a statement confirming that Slator has been fired as a result of the controversy.\
  \ \"Aaron Slator has been terminated. There is no place for demeaning behavior within\
  \ AT&T and we regret the action was not taken earlier.\" Notable Examples Derivatives\
  \ Second World Success Kid On November 30th, 2011, a spin-off image macro series\
  \ known as Second World Success[20] emerged on Reddit, which featured a picture\
  \ of a smiling child waving a Chinese flag and various captions criticizing the\
  \ developing nation's controversial issues of child labor laws and censorship of\
  \ free speech. Collections of notable Instances were subsequently posted on Memebase[21],\
  \ FunnyJunk[22], and #1 Meme Universal Trend.[23] Skeptical Third World Success\
  \ Kid On June 22nd, 2012, Redditor anute3392 submitted a photograph of an Ugandan\
  \ child titled \"Skeptical 3rd World Child\"[28] to the /r/pics subreddit. Apparently\
  \ taken by Redditor Nepalm[32] during her trip to Uganda as a voluntary member of\
  \ the Student Global Health Alliance, the photograph became an instant favorite\
  \ and reached the frontpage of Reddit within hours of upload. Though the child in\
  \ the photo has not been identified, the woman has been confirmed to be Heena Pranav,\
  \ a doctor from Chicago who was in Uganda on a charity mission at the time.[35]\
  \ The thread[28] went onto receive more than 17,000 upvotes and 725 comments in\
  \ the first 24 hours, as well as spawning a series of image macros with captions\
  \ alluding to the Third World Success Kid and the Skeptical Baby, an advice animal\
  \ character based on a photo of an eyebrow-raising infant that emerged months earlier\
  \ in January 2012. The majority of notable examples poked fun at the drastically\
  \ different standards of living in the First World countries or the White Man's\
  \ Guilt mentality, some Redditors quickly rebutted with a number of instances criticizing\
  \ the community's inclination towards slacktivism and trivializing the grave issue\
