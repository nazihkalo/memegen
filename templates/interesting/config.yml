  \ Man In The World is an advice animal character inspired by the titular protagonist\
  \ of the highly successful advertising campaign for the Dos Equis beer brand that\
  \ ran from 2006 to 2018. In the image macro series, the character is depicted as\
  \ a highly charismatic and well-traveled gentleman with refined tastes in many things,\
  \ much like the nameless bearded man originally portrayed in the campaign, often\
  \ accompanied by captions based on the phrasal template \"I don't always X, but\
  \ when I do, I Y.\" Origin The advertising campaign was created by the global marketing\
  \ firm Euro RSCG Worldwide.[2] The ads starred American actor Jonathan Goldsmith[3]\
  \ as \u201Cthe most interesting man\u201D with narration by Will Lyman[4], best\
  \ known for his narrating role in the public affairs TV program Frontline. Goldsmith's\
  \ character is known for his catchphrases \"I don't always drink beer, but when\
  \ I do, I prefer Dos Equis,\" and \"Stay thirsty, my friends.\" \"I don't always\
  \ drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis,\" and \"Stay thirsty, my friends.\"\
  \ The ads first aired in the United States in 2006 and were uploaded to the wistl1976\
  \ YouTube[15] channel on April 10th, 2007. The same month, the promotional website\
  \ StayThirstyMyFriends.com[6] was launched, where fans could upload videos of themselves\
  \ performing toasts with a bottle of Dos Equis. Spread On November 18th, 2007, the\
  \ advertising news blog Advertising 305[7] published a post about the ads, calling\
  \ the campaign \"a stroke of genius.\" On December 9th, Time Magazine[8] listed\
  \ Dos Equiis as a top TV ad of 2007. On April 24th, 2008, a thread was posted about\
  \ the campaign on the Texas Longhorns enthusiast HornsFans[16] forums, in which\
  \ forum member wolfman compared Goldsmith's character to the martial artist Chuck\
  \ Norris. On May 25th, 2009, the news blog Slate[10] published an article, claiming\
  \ the ads took \"aesthetic cues\" from the work of film director Wes Anderson. On\
  \ June 4th, the food blog Eat Me Daily[5] posted about the campaign, remarking that\
  \ the character had its own Twitter-impersonator (the Twitter[17] account has since\
  \ been deleted). On July 2nd, People Magazine[11] interviewed Jonathan Goldsmith,\
  \ who revealed he lived on a 47-foot boat in California. An archived 4chan[19] post\
  \ with racist versions of the Goldsmith character dates back to August 3rd. The\
  \ Internet Wayback Machine's[18] first snapshot of the Meme Generator[1] page for\
  \ \"Most Interesting Man in the World\" was taken on November 22nd. The page allowed\
  \ users to created image macros using a photo of the Goldsmith as the Dos Equis\
  \ man. In January of 2010, a Quickmeme page for \"The Most Interesting Man in the\
  \ World\" was created, in which the first image macro was captioned with \"I don't\
  \ masturbate often / but when I do, I use women.\" On February 11th, Vitamin Water\
  \ began a parody campaign called \"The Most Ridiculous Man in the World\" featuring\
  \ Canadian basketball player Steve Nash. In the videos, Nash is portrayed as a bizarre\
  \ character who says the catchphrase \"I don't always drink water, but when I do,\
  \ it's Vitamin Water\" and \"Stay vitaminized, my friends.\" As of April 10th, 2012,\
  \ a Quickmeme[13] page has over 96,000 submissions and a Facebook[14] page has received\
  \ over 243,000 likes. Ask Me Anything (AMA) On August 1st, 2013, actor Jonathan\
  \ Goldsmith started an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session on Reddit to raise donations\
  \ for Clear Path International and Mines Advisory Group, two non-profit organizations\
  \ that are dedicated to aiding Vietnamese people who have been injured by land mines\
  \ and explosives forgotten from the Vietnam War. Q: What is your favorite \"Most\
  \ interesting man in the world\" fact? A: He once warned a psychic. Q: Do you realize\
  \ that you have INSANE sex appeal to woman (and men) of all ages? A: It has been\
  \ rumored and I rather like it. Q: Who do you think is the second most interesting\
  \ man in the world? A: Nelson Mandela is actually first, but don't blow my cover\
  \ Q: How did you get the part in this commercial? Was this persona of \"the most\
  \ interesting man\" something you or Dos Equis came up with? What is your favorite\
  \ place to travel? A: The beginning was a cattle call of over 500 people. I didn't\
  \ think I was what they wanted for the role and forgot about it. a month later\u2026\
  \ it was 200 people. Then 6 more weeks went by and they still had not found who\
  \ they were looking for. They went on a casting mission both nationally and internationally.\
  \ I screen tested with three other fellows and I was the lucky one. Listen closely\
  \ and you will hear the sound of knocking wood. Q: What are the 7 words Eskimos\
  \ use to call your beard? A: 1) lovely 2) strong 3) ticklish 4) charming 5) mysterious\
  \ 6) tasty 7) electric Q: How do you feel about the level of popularity of your\
  \ memes? A: I'm very honored and consider it a mantle of pride to live up to. For\
  \ the most part the jokes are enjoyable and I am grateful that people take the time.\
  \ Q: What event / moment made you realize that the commercial you made was something\
  \ special? A: When I was recognized by a 7 year old in a Mexican restaurant as what\
  \ he wanted to be when he grew up, and a week later in NYC being knighted with an\
  \ old man's cane on a bus. He was in his eighties and he said \"Sonny when I come\
  \ back, I want to be you.\" Retirement During Super Bowl 50, Dos Equis premiered\
  \ a commercial in which The Most Interesting Man in the World embarks on a one-way\
  \ trip to Mars. The 60-second commercial reunited many of the groups from past commercials,\
  \ who all said goodbye to Goldsmith as he boarded a space shuttle. [This video has\
  \ been removed] On March 9th, 2016, Dos Equis announced that the commercial was\
  \ officially Goldsmith's last, and that while the concept of the most interesting\
  \ person in the world would continue in future advertisements, this particular character\
  \ had been retired. They used the hashtag #AdiosAmigo to promote the retirement.\
  \ According to a lawsuit by a former agent, Goldsmith had made over $900,000 in\
  \ 2015 alone by playing the character on television. 2016 Campaign In September\
  \ 2016, Dos Equis unveiled a new, Spanish-speaking version of the character in a\
  \ commercial titled \"Meet the New Most Interesting Man in the World\" (shown below).\
  \ In the ad, a man steps up to a bar where the bartender asks, \"think you will\
  \ ever as interesting as him\" while pointing to a commercial featuring the original\
