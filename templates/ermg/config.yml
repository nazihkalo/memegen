  \ pronunciation of \"oh my god,\" is an image macro series featuring a photo of\
  \ a young woman holding several books from the children\u2019s horror fiction series\
  \ Goosebumps. The phonetically written captions are meant to sound like a speech\
  \ impediment caused by the use of an orthodontic retainer, often using the snowclone\
  \ template \"Ermahgerd X.\" Origin On March 14th, 2012, a post titled \"Just a book\
  \ owners smile\u2026\" was submitted to the /r/funny[9] subreddit with a photo of\
  \ a young girl posing with three Goosebumps books and her mouth agape in excitement.\
  \ A comment posted by Redditor plantlife[10] linked to a Quickmeme submission of\

  \ image macro was submitted in a post titled \"BERKS!\"[1] which reached the front\
  \ page of Reddit accumulating over 17,000 up votes within two weeks. Precursors\
  \ The humorous trope of \"retainer lisp\" has been portrayed through various characters\
  \ in popular TV shows and films, such as Beth from the animated series Total Drama\
  \ Island (shown left) and Stan\u2019s sister Shelly from the animated television\
  \ series South Park (shown right). Spread On March 15th, 2012, the image macro was\

  \ the title \"Thurrrrr So Scurrrrry.\" On March 16th, YouTuber Berks Gerl uploaded\
  \ a video titled \"Mah Fravorit Berks!\", which featured the original image macro\
  \ accompanied by a voice-over narration of the caption. On March 19th, Body Building[7]\
  \ forums member Wilsbrah posted a thread titled \"Gersberms!\" with the original\
  \ macro embedded in the post. Other forum members responded to the thread using\
  \ incorrect English mimicking the caption. On June 4th, Redditor TycoBrahe submitted\
  \ a post titled \"Ermahgerd! Cluhrnet!\", which included an animated GIF of Malena\
  \ Ernman performing a rendition of the orchestral interlude \"Flight of the Bumblee.\"\
  \ Within 16 days, the post received over 8,700 up votes and 270 comments. On June\
  \ 16th, Graphic Design Forum[23] member KitchWitch submitted a thread titled \"\
  Ermahgerd\", which included several notable image macros from the series. The meme\
  \ has continued to spread on Memebase[17] and Tumblr[18] under the tag \"#ermahgerd.\"\
  \ As of June 20th, 2012, the \u201CBerks\u201D Quickmeme[3] page has received over\
  \ 4,200 submissions, the \u201CErmahgerd\u201D Meme Generator[20]page has received\
  \ more than 1,000 items and a Facebook[21] page for \u201CErmahgerd, Berks\u201D\
  \ has accumulated over 990 likes. Various Examples Identity On March 28th, 2012,\
  \ a post titled \u201CBERKS Revealed\u201D was submitted to the /r/adviceanimals[11]\
  \ subreddit by user superdude4agze, which included a picture of a young woman with\
  \ the caption \u201CErmahgerd / I\u2019m hot\u201D (shown left). The following day,\
  \ a post comparing the facial features in the two photos (shown middle) reached\
  \ the front page of Reddit[12], which sparked a lengthy discussion over the authenticity\
  \ of Superdude5agze's photo. On March 30th, Redditor ThazCrazy submitted a post\
  \ to the /r/self[22] subreddit titled \"Actual BERKS Girl\", which included a photo\
  \ of a woman named Maggie (shown right) whom ThazCrazy claimed was the real Berks\
  \ woman. On October 15th, 2015, Vanity Fair published an extensive investigation\
  \ into the meme, including an interview with Maggie Goldenberger, the woman originally\
  \ pointed out by ThazCrazy. Goldberger spoke about how it felt to encounter herself\
  \ online.[27] Maggie Goldenberger, in a picture from Vanity Fair Three years after\
  \ first becoming an unwitting meme star, Goldenberger, who works as a nurse in Phoenix,\
  \ still occasionally experiences the surreal, stupefying jolt of being ambushed\
  \ by her own face online. \u201CMy eyes just get wide and I say, out loud, \u2018\
  This is so f--king weird.\u2019 \u201D The magazine also identified the reddit user\
  \ plantlife as the originator of the phrase \"Gersberms / Mah fravrit berks.\" The\
  \ article went on to tell the story of how Goldenberger and her friends took the\
  \ original photograph. When Maggie Goldenberger was in fourth or fifth grade, she\
  \ and her friends seriously got into playing dress-up. They would rummage through\
  \ a dress-up box full of accessories owned by Goldenberger\u2019s friend Kaelyn\
  \ and devise outrageous outfits, inventing eccentric characters and snapping Polaroids\
  \ of each other. . . \u201CI remember having a lot of fun picking out the items,\u201D\
  \ she said, \u201Cand Kaelyn running downstairs to pick out books.\u201D Kaelyn\
  \ had suggested that Goldenberger should hold the American Girl doll tie-in books,\
  \ with their saccharine pastel covers of smiling tween girls. Crucially, it was\
  \ the Goosebumps books, with their instantly recognizable hyper-colored cover images\
  \ by illustrator Tim Jacobus, that made the cut. Deciding against the coonskin cap,\
  \ Goldenberger put on the vest, hoisted her hair up into intentionally dorky pigtails--she\
  \ never wore them like that otherwise--brandished the chosen books, and pulled an\
  \ intentionally hideous face for the camera. Normally, she hardly ever wore her\
  \ retainer like she was supposed to, but it felt right for the character: she put\
  \ it on for the shoot. According to the article, the embarrassing photo was then\
  \ uploaded to Myspace and Facebook until it was discovered.[27] Animal Variations\
  \ On June 8th, 2012, the website I Can Has Cheezburger[19] published a post titled\
  \ \"Animal Memes: Ermahgerd! Er'm a Perg!\", which featured a photo of a pug staring\
  \ at a box of Milk-Bone dog treats with the caption \"Ermahgerd / merlkbehrns\"\
  \ (shown below, left). On June 16th, the pug image was submitted in a post titled\
  \ \u201Cmerlkbehrns\u201D on the image remixing site Canvas[16], where it received\
  \ several replies with other variations based on cute animal photos that were captioned\
  \ with the snowclone template \"Ermahgerd X\" (shown below, middle, right). On June\
  \ 18th, the Tumblr[15] blog Pleated Jeans published several images from the thread\
  \ in a post which received over 67,300 notes within two days. The following day,\
  \ the same images were published in a post titled \"7 Super Excited 'Ermahgerd'\
  \ Animals\" on the viral content site BuzzFeed.[14] Hurricane Irma On August 30th,\
  \ 2017, Hurricane Irma developed off a tropical wave that moved off the west African\
  \ coast, which rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane. On September 5th,\
  \ 2017, Irma was classified as a Category 5 hurricane. On the morning of September\
  \ 6th, it reached peak intensity, with winds up to 185 mph, tying it for the second\
  \ most intense hurricanes in Atlantic history. On September 9th, Twitter user @ziyatong[28]\
  \ tweeted a photograph of a boarded-up house with the words \"Irma Gerd\" spray-painted\
  \ on the side (shown below). Within 48 hours, the tweet gained over 22,000 likes\
  \ and 64,000 retweets. Meanwhile, Twitter user AtterburyTCPalm posted a similar\
  \ photograph of a boarded-up home decorated with the same graffiti (shown below,\
  \ right). Meanwhile, several news sites published articles about the Ermahgerd-themed\
  \ Hurricane Irma memes, including Miami New Times,[29] Heavy[30] and Newsweek.[31]\
  \ Interview with Know Your Meme On January 8th, 2021, Know Your Meme interviewed\
  \ Maggie Goldenburger about the origins of the original photo, history with the\
  \ meme and more nine years after it spread online. Search Interest In its beginning,\
  \ the meme was primarily referred to as \"Berks\" after the original instance of\
  \ the series, but as it continued to spawn derivatives based on other images, the\
  \ more generic term \"Ermahgerd\" surpassed the former in terms of search interest\
