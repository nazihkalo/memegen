scraped_content: 'About Pepperidge Farm Remembers is an image macro series based on
  a tagline used in an advertisement for the commercial bakery Pepperidge Farm. The
  series features a still-shot from a parody of the commercial as seen in the animated
  television series Family Guy and captions reminiscing about outdated relics and
  practices from the past decades. Origin In the early 1980s, Pepperidge Farm began
  airing a commercial featuring an elderly man reminiscing about raisin bread that
  his grandmother used to make with the tagline “Pepperidge Farm remembers” (shown
  below, left). Online interest in the commercial resurged more than a decade later
  with a Family Guy parody in Season 5 Episode 3 “Hell Comes to Quahod,” in which
  an old man blackmails the audience into buying Milano cookies. The episode was originally
  aired on September 24th, 2006. On June 4th, 2012, Redditor redherpbluederp submitted
  a post to the /r/funny[6] subreddit titled “God dammit, YouTube commentator!”, which
  included a screenshot of a YouTube comment referencing the Pepperidge Farm commercial
  (shown below). Within four months, the post received over 12,725 up votes and 190
  comments. Spread On June 6th, the Tumblr[2] blog “Pepperidge Farm Remembers” was
  launched with two image macros referencing Ja Rule and MTV, though it has been most

  “Pepperidge Farm,”[7] featuring an image macro using the company logo with the caption

  (shown below). Within three months, the post received over 6,100 up votes and 145
  comments. On August 8th, Redditor cystalbyb submitted an image macro to the /r/memes[8]
  subreddit featuring the caption “Remember when Cartoon Netowork only played cartoons?
  / Pepperidge Farm remembers” (shown below, left). On October 1st, Redditor Trollsamabinlolin
  submitted an image macro to the /r/AdviceAnimals[7]subreddit with the caption “Remember
