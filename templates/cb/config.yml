  \ Recent Videos About Confession Bear is an advice animal image macro series featuring\
  \ a photo of a Malayan sun bear leaning against a log. The images are captioned\
  \ with confessions about taboo behaviors and controversial opinions that are often\
  \ kept secret for fear of being ostracized. Origin The original bear photo (shown\
  \ below, left) was taken by photojournalist Clemens Bilan and was submitted to the\
  \ stock photo website Getty Images[14] on April 12th, 2007. Several years later\
  \ on June 21st, 2012, Redditor F-18Bro submitted a post titled \"I have a lot of\
  \ weird stuff that I'd like to b able to confess to reddit so i can get it off my\
  \ chest, so I made Confession Bear\"[1], which included another image macro of the\
  \ bear with the caption \"I absolutely love / the smell of my own balls\" (shown\
  \ below, right). Within four days, the post received over 13,000 up votes and 1,100\
  \ comments. Spread On June 21st, 2012, several hours after F-18Bro's Reddit post,\
  \ a page for \"Confession Bear\" was created on the image macro website Quickmeme.[3]\
  \ The same day, the single topic blog ConfessionBear.com[6] was launched and the\
  \ @ConfessionBear_ Twitter[8] account was created. Also on June 21st, Redditor Zmo64\
  \ submitted a post titled \"Confession Bear\", featuring a Bear Grylls image macro\
  \ with the caption \"Sometimes / I drink my own piss\" (shown below, left). Shortly\
  \ after, Redditor PhtoJoe submitted a Futurama Fry example commenting on the captions\
  \ used in the series (shown below, right). On June 23rd, the Internet humor site\
  \ The FW[11] published a post titled \"Funniest Memes of the Week\", which featured\
  \ Confession Bear as the staff favorite. The meme has continued to spread on the\
  \ microblogging site Tumblr under the tag \"#confession bear.\"[10] As of June 25th,\
  \ 2012, the Quickmeme page has accumulated over 1,800 submissions. Notable Examples\
  \ Confession Tiger On August 6th, 2012, Redditor Zachcvh submitted an image macro\
  \ of a bored-looking tiger paired with the caption \"I ate that bear\" in an /r/AdviceAnimals\
  \ post titled \"Confession Tiger.\"[31] In the following 24 hours, a number of additional\
  \ \"Confession Tiger\", also known as Terrible Tiger, image macros placing the tiger\
  \ and the bear in a rivalry were submitted to the subreddit. Throughout 2012 and\
  \ 2013, at least 80 image macro instances of the Confession Tiger were submitted\
  \ to Reddit's /r/AdviceAnimals[32], although many of them turned out to be reposts\
  \ or variations on the existing theme of the tiger's jealousy towards the bear.\
  \ Confession Kid On April 27th, 2013, Redditor Notmiefault submitted an image macro\
  \ titled \"Confession Kid\" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[2] subreddit, in which the OP\
  \ recalled his naive belief as a child that automatic doors were controlled by an\
  \ unseen operator using a surveillance camera (shown below, left). Throughout May,\
  \ dozens of additional Confession Kid image macros looking back on embarrassing\
  \ memories and tales from childhood continued to surface on Reddit's /r/AdviceAnimals.\
  \ Murder Confession Controversy On April 7th, 2013, Redditor Naratto submitted a\
  \ Confession Bear image macro to the /r/AdviceAnimals[15] subreddit, which included\
  \ a caption confessing to the murder of his sister's meth-addicted boyfriend (shown\
  \ below). Within 24 hours, the post received over 10,100 up votes and 3,100 comments.\
  \ In the comments section of the post, Redditors began discussing the authenticity\
  \ of the confession, with many noting its similarity to a scene in which the character\
  \ Walt witnesses a heroin addict die in the television drama series Breaking Bad.[16]\
  \ Other Redditors posted his name, Facebook page, employer and other personally\
  \ identifiable information in the comments section, which were subsequently removed\
  \ by moderators. Naratto responded by submitting a Super Cool Ski Instructor image\
  \ macro in a new post on the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit,[25] claiming that the confession\
  \ was just a joke with \"some truth behind it\" (shown below) before deleting his\
  \ entire account. The same day, Redditor Alcoholocaustic submitted a post to the\
  \ /r/KarmaConspiracy[19] subreddit, which accused Naratto of posting the Confession\
  \ Bear image macro to gain karma on the site. Within 24 hours, the post gained upwards\
  \ of 2,000 up votes and 120 comments. On April 8th, Redditor lemon_difficult submitted\
  \ a Confession Bear image macro to the /r/circlejerk[20] subreddit, featuring a\
  \ caption confessing to the murder of an Office Depot employee with his own stapler\
  \ (shown below). In the following eight hours, the post accumulated more than 4,000\
  \ up votes and 130 comments. Also on April 8th, the Internet news blog The Daily\
  \ Dot[17] published an article about the Reddit post, noting that a murder had been\
  \ previously confessed on an Internet support group in 1998. Also on April 8th,\
  \ the confession was reported on by several other news sites, including Gawker,[18]\
  \ Examiner,[21] UpRoxx,[22] International Business Times[23] and MSN.[24] Several\
  \ image macros referencing the confession were created shortly thereafter, featuring\
  \ other advice animal characters like Internet Husband, Futurama Fry and Bad Luck\
  \ Brian (shown below). Naratto's Identity Upon discovering that Naratto did not\
  \ use an ad hoc account (also known as a throwaway account) to post his Confession\
  \ Bear image macro, Redditors began sifting through his post history to gather clues\
  \ about his real identity, soon leading to the doxing of his age, birthdate, middle\
  \ name, military record and work information. His handle Naratto was also traced\
  \ to a long-forgotten Twitter account[26] that belongs to a San Diego resident named\
  \ Colton R. Goodbrand. On April 10th, Gawker[27] published an article detailing\
  \ Naratto's online identity with numerous links to his social media profiles on\
  \ Twitter, MySpace and LinkedIn, as well as a YouTube video starring Goodbrand.\
  \ Three days later, a San Diego NBC news affiliate[30] reported that the local police\
  \ had received a tip about the Gawker post and were launching an investigation with\
  \ their cold case team. On April 16th, Gawker received an e-mail from Goodbrand\
  \ confirming that he did make the Confession Bear post and threatening legal action\
  \ if the site didn't remove the article containing his personal information. As\
  \ of April 17th, the post is still online, but a similar post on the Daily Mail[29]\
