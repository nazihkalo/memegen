  \ Ruling On August 15th, 2018, Sweden's Advertising Ombudsman, an advertising watchdog\

  \ after it was used by the recruiting company Bahnhof in a recruiting ad showing\
  \ \"Bahnhof\" labeled as the attractive woman and \"your current job\" labeled as\
  \ the girlfriend[43] (shown below). The Ombudsman unanimously ruled the ad to be\

  \ in the same way as a change of workplace.\" The Ombudsman cannot impose sanctions,\
  \ only pass judgment. The ruling was covered by CNET.[44] Wedding Photo On September\

  \ preferable over letting immigrants into the country. [48] On March 13th, Facebook\

  \ cover (shown below, right). The user did not accuse the paper of plagiarism. They\
  \ wrote, \"Such things are unavoidable. One can only hope that this is a coincidence.\
  \ In their defense, they use only black font color.\" That day, Twitter[55] published\
  \ an Events page about the cover. Additionally, New York[56] magazine covered the\
  \ meme writing, \"Everyone please give a warm round of applause to the New York\
  \ Times, which arrived in the year 2017 this week in a big way. The paper of record\
  \ published its own version of the \u201CDistracted Boyfriend\u201D meme on Wednesday,\

  \ do so, posting the image on September 28th, 2018 to /r/memes[61] with the caption\
  \ \"They are old guys\" (shown below). The following day, the picture was tweeted\
  \ by Zach Braff[62] with the caption, \"This is how much 2018 has aged us all. On\
