scraped_content: 'About Distracted Boyfriend, also known as Man Looking at Other Woman,
  is an object labeling stock photo series in which a man looks at the backside of
  a woman walking by while another woman, presumably his romantic partner, looks on
  disapprovingly. Origin On November 1st, 2015, the source image, taken by photographer
  Antonio Guillem, was posted on the stock photo database iStock[1] under the description
  "Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl" (shown below, left).
  According to a post published on the Meme Documentation [14] Tumblr blog, the earliest
  known captioned version of the photo was submitted to a Turkish Facebook group at
  an unknown date. On January 30th, 2017, the Prog Düşmanlarına Verilen Müthiş Cevaplar
  Facebook[13] page posted the image with captions identifying the man as Phil Collins
  peering pop music while prog music looks on (shown below, right). The creator of
  Phil Collins meme has since stated that they were inspired by the political meme
  page "Siyasettin," whose earliest available version of a Distracted Boyfriend meme
  was also posted on January 30th, 2017. Spread On February 23rd, 2017, Instagram
  user @_dekhbai_[2] posted the image with the caption "Tag That Friend / Who Falls
  in Love Every Month" (shown below, left). Within seven months, the post gained over
  28,500 likes. On August 19th, Twitter user @n1m161 posted the stock depicting the
  man staring longingly at "socialism" while "capitalism" looks on (shown below, right).
  On August 21st, Redditor danikger submitted a captioned version of the photo in
  which the man looks back at the 2017 solar eclipse while being stared at by "scientific
  evidence supporting the dangers of staring at the sun" (shown below). Within 24
  hours, the post gained over 31,200 points (93% upvoted) and 130 comments on /r/me_irl.[3]
  In the coming days, several posts about the meme format were submitted to /r/MemeEconomy.[5][6][7][8]
  In March of 2018, Slate[42] cited Distracted Boyfriend as one of the memes most
  influential to the spread of the Object Labeling trend of the late 2010s. On December
  29th, 2022, Rainbolt uploaded a video on Instagram showing the location where the
  photo was taken.[65] It was in the city of Girona, Spain. The specific street''s
  name is Carrer Nou, 31. The video received over 533,000 likes in 3 weeks (shown,
  below). Photo Series Compilations As the popularity of the stock photo started to
  spread, people discovered similar stock photos in the series with the same actors
  in various scenarios. On August 22nd, Tumblr user klubbhead posted a compilation
  of similar photos from the series, featuring the man looking at the same woman at
  various instances with at the end showing his romantic partner in disstress and
  questioning why she didn''t dump him.[9] Klubbhead added a reply to his post the
  next day, showing a photo of the man annoyed at his partner''s shopping habits;
  alongside 2 series of stock photos from the set with the first showing the initial
  man and woman being a happy couple once (shown below, left) and the latter showing
  them all 3 being together with the implication that they all had intercourse together
  eventually (shown below, right).[10] As of August 25th, the post gathered over 47,500
  notes. On August 24th, Twitter user @akfamilyhomeak[11] posted a tweet featuring
  a similar scenario, but instead showing the two women from the series getting closer
  to each other with the man being blurry in the background. Later that day, Twitter
  user @oranforest[12] added a photo to the same series as @akfamilyhomeak, featuring
  the two women being together with the implication that they got together (shown
  below). Interviews With The Photographer And Models In late August, photographer
  Antonio Guillem gave several interviews about the photograph to various news sites,
  including Wired[17] and The Guardian,[16] in which he revealed he didn''t known
  what a meme was until recently. On August 29th, NY Mag[15] published an interview
  conducted by Guillem with the models from the photo. Distracted Girlfriend In late
  October 2017, another photograph by Antonion Guillem was discovered on Shutterstock[18]
  in which the roles were reversed, depicting a man''s girlfriend looking lustfully
  at a man passing by (shown below). On October 29th, 2017, Redditor toastr submitted
  an image featuring the new stock photo placed underneath the original Distracted
  Boyfriend picture, along with the caption "The tables have turned." Within 24 hours,
  the post gained over 25,600 points (92% upvoted) and 240 comments. That day, Redditor
  J0Aco777 reposted the image macro to /r/dankmemes,[19] where it garnered upwards
  of 8,400 points (91% upvoted) and 110 comments over the next day. Meanwhile, a photoshopped
  variation of the image was submitted by Redditor SteW- to /r/me_irl, featuring the
  original Distracted Boyfriend as the jealous boyfriend (shown below).[20] On October
  30th, The Daily Dot[21] published an article about the new stock photo titled "Distracted
  girlfriend brings gender equality to the meme world." Henry Cavill Photoshops On

  have worked in its original context." They posted the painting with each of the

  On August 15th, 2018, Sweden''s Advertising Ombudsman, an advertising watchdog company,
  judged that the use of Distracted Boyfriend in advertising was sexist after it was
  used by the recruiting company Bahnhof in a recruiting ad showing "Bahnhof" labeled
  as the attractive woman and "your current job" labeled as the girlfriend[43] (shown
  below). The Ombudsman unanimously ruled the ad to be "gender-discriminatory" and
  suggestive of the idea that women are "interchangeable in the same way as a change
  of workplace." The Ombudsman cannot impose sanctions, only pass judgment. The ruling
  was covered by CNET.[44] Wedding Photo On September 29th, 2018, Redditor Lyude posted

  please give a warm round of applause to the New York Times, which arrived in the
