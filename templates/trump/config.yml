  \ his bid for the Republican primaries in the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election\

  \ all major news outlets, including both traditional and online publications, generating\
  \ the highest volume of Google search queries for any of the presidential candidates\
  \ to date. In the weeks following his announcement, at least two public opinion\
  \ polls were conducted by the Suffolk University and Fox News, with the former survey\
  \ indicating Trump as the second most popular Republican candidate among likely\
  \ voters in New Hampshire's primary for the Republican nomination and the latter\
  \ poll similarly placing Trump in second place among Republican-registered voters\

  \ launched a tirade against Republican senator Lindsey Graham while giving a speech\
  \ at a campaign rally event in South Carolina, shortly after the circulation of\
  \ headlines[25] that his rival primary candidate called him a \"jackass\" on the\
  \ previous day. During his speech[26], Trump shot back at the South Carolina senator\
  \ by calling him a \u201Clightweight\u201D and an \u201Cidiot,\" while making a\
  \ disparaging comparison to another Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry.\
  \ \u201CHe doesn\u2019t seem like a very bright guy. He actually probably seems\
  \ to me not as bright as Rick Perry. I think Rick Perry probably is smarter than\
  \ Lindsey Graham.\" Trump then wrapped up his diatribe by reading out the private\
  \ phone number belonging to Lindsey Graham and encouraging his supporters to \"\

  \ phone number belonging to Donald Trump in an article titled \"Call Donald Trump's\
  \ Cell Phone and Ask Him About His Important Ideas.\" Prefaced with a note about\
  \ Trump's disclosure of Republican senator Lindsey Graham's phone number at a campaign\
  \ rally in July, the publication called on its readers to ask him questions by dialing\
  \ the listed number: You can reach Donald Trump at 917-756-8000. He has some pressing\
  \ questions to answer. Does he still think Mexicans are out to rape you? Speaking\
  \ of rape, does he think it\u2019s possible to rape your own wife? Just how much\
  \ did he exaggerate his net worth to hit the $10 billion figure? What about breast\
  \ milk does he find so disgusting? Which cabinet position would he give Sarah Palin?\
  \ Interesting topics, all. Gawker's disclosure of Donald Trump's phone number was\
  \ subsequently picked up by numerous major political news sites and blogs, including\
  \ ABC News[26], Politico[28], MSNBC[29] The Hill[30] and more[27], with MSNBC confirming\

  \ made an appearance at Donald Trump's campaign rally event in Ames, Iowa to declare\
  \ her endorsement of the controversial Republican presidential front-runner. During\
  \ her 20-minute long speech on stage (shown below), the former Republican vice presidential\
  \ candidate reprised her notoriously militant brand of populism, or Palin-ism, filled\
  \ with phrases like \"pussy-footin',\" \"hallelujah\" and \"you betcha.\" Palin's\
  \ endorsement of Trump as the Republican presidential nominee was first picked up\
  \ by the New York Times, followed by virtually all major U.S. news publications\
  \ and networks covering the primaries campaign trail, many of which highlighted\
  \ the former Alaskan governor's endorsement as a substantial boost towards Donald\
  \ Trump's victory in the upcoming Iowa and New Hampshire caucuses. Meanwhile on\
  \ Twitter and elsewhere in the social media, Palin's surprise appearance at Donald\
  \ Trump's campaign rally instantly became a target of mockeries as a video clip\
  \ of her rambling speech began circulating on Vine (shown below), which has garnered\
  \ almost 20 million views within the first 72 hours. Online Presence Donald Trump's\
  \ official website was registered at Trump.com[11] on July 9th, 1997, which features\

  \ has a history of provocative and racial Facebook posts\" detailing a history of\
  \ racially charged status updates and controversial commentaries made by Sam Nunberg,\
  \ a New York City attorney and one of Trump's political advisors, via his personal\
  \ Facebook account since 2007. In one of his status updates, dated August 25th,\
  \ 2007, Nunberg posted a facetious remark about calling American Reverend and civil\

  \ revealed announced Nunberg has been terminated from his position in the wake of\
  \ the recent revelations. Prior to this incident, Nunberg had been previously fired\

  \ article for BuzzFeed in early 2014. Trump's Twitter Outage On November 2nd, 2017,\
  \ President Trump's Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump was pulled offline for 11\
  \ minutes. During that time, people on the site speculated whether his account had\
  \ been suspended, removed or hacked (examples below). Following the account blackout,\
  \ Twitter's official government account[81][82] responded to the controversy, stating\
  \ that a rogue employee shut @realDonaldTrump down on their last day. Over two tweets,\

  \ due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes,\
  \ and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps\
  \ to prevent this from happening again[\u2026]Through our investigation we have\

  \ On January 20th, 2016, LA-based comedian Elijah Daniel tweeted a message[47] pledging\
  \ to get heavily intoxicated and write an entire erotica novella featuring Donald\
  \ Trump in the style of the 2011 best-selling erotica novel 50 Shades of Grey, partly\
  \ inspired by a Huffington Post article[48] which reported on an unconfirmed rumor\
  \ that Trump allegedly \"paid off\" a gay lover to prevent their affair from breaking\
  \ out into a public scandal. While the article in question was deleted from the\
  \ site shortly afterwards, Daniel completed his short story overnight and put it\
  \ up for sale on Amazon's Kindle e-Book store on the following day. Titled \"Trump\
  \ Temptation: The Billionaire & The Bellboy,\" the adult-themed novella focuses\
  \ on a one night stand between a toupee-wearing billionaire and a mysterious bellboy\
  \ at a hotel. According to the official description: He was a billionaire, I was\
  \ a bellboy, can I make it anymore obvious? It all started one fateful afternoon\
  \ in summer of 2012. I was working as a bellboy at the Trump Hotel in Hong Kong\
  \ on an internship program. This was my first time in a big city. It was all I could\
  \ have ever dreamed of, and more. But little did I know, it was all about to change.\
  \ Upon announcing the release of the story, Daniel's tweet[49] quickly went viral,\
  \ garnering nearly 8,000 tweets and over 8,000 likes within the first 72 hours,\
  \ as well as the novel[50] itself, which became an instant hit among parody reviewers\
  \ and soon rose to the #1 best seller in the LGBT Erotica and Humorous Erotica categories\
  \ on Amazon's general book and e-book charts. Naked Trump Statues On August 18th,\
  \ 2016, statues of Donald Trump naked with tiny genitalia appeared in New York City,\
  \ San Francisco, Cleveland, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles.[69] They were erected\
  \ by the anarchist collective INDECLINE as part of a series called \"The Emperor\
  \ Has No Balls,\" referring to what the nude statues of Trump were lacking. Cleveland\
  \ was the first to remove their statue. The New York City Parks Department responded\
  \ to the statue in a statement that read \"NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted\
  \ erection in city parks, no matter how small.\"[70] Reputation In addition to his\
  \ signature role as the founder, chairman, CEO and president of the Trump Organization,\
  \ Donald Trump has established himself in public as a celebrity businessman who\
  \ enjoys and understands extravagant lifestyle, especially through his role on the\
  \ NBC reality TV show The Apparentice, which culminated with the inclusions of his\
  \ name on Forbes' Celebrity 100 list (#17) and Gallup's Ten Most Admired Men and\
  \ Women Alive poll in 2011.[15] Meanwhile, due to his outspoken manner in public,\
  \ coupled with conspicuous display of personal wealth and staunch advocacy of conservative\
  \ agendas mainly corporate deregulation, Trump has also become a frequent target\
  \ of ridicule in pop culture and on the Internet. Race-Related Controversies Anti-Mexican\
  \ Remarks During the announcement of his presidential campaign in June 2015, Trump\
  \ made several remarks addressing the issue of illegal immigration across the U.S.\
  \ southern borders (quoted below), which instantly prompted a flurry of criticisms\
  \ and accusations of generalizing the Mexican population from various news media\
  \ outlets and Hispanics on social media. \"When Mexico sends its people they're\
  \ not sending the best,\" said Trump. \"They're not sending you, they're sending\
  \ people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're\
  \ bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are\
  \ good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting.\"\
  \ Univision's Response In late June 2015, the New York City-based Spanish language\
  \ TV network Univision[18] announced that the company would terminate its business\
  \ relationship and broadcast contract with the Miss Universe Organization, on the\
  \ grounds of what it perceived as \"insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants\"\
  \ made by the pageantry co-owner Trump during his campaign announcement in the 2016\
  \ U.S. presidential election. Today, the entertainment division of Univision Communications\
  \ Inc. announced that it is ending the Company\u2019s business relationship with\
  \ the Miss Universe Organization, which is part-owned by Donald J. Trump, based\
  \ on his recent, insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants. At Univision, we see\
  \ first-hand the work ethic, love for family, strong religious values and the important\
  \ role Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans have had and will continue to have\
  \ in building the future of our country. We will not be airing the Miss USA pageant\
  \ on July 12th or working on any other projects tied to the Trump Organization.\
  \ The next day, Trump issued a personally-signed open letter in response to Univision's\
  \ decision via his Facebook page[17], in which he notified the American news media\
  \ company to immediately stop using Trump National Doral Miami, a Florida-based\
  \ golf resort known to be frequented by Univision executives, while sarcastically\
  \ congratulating the Mexican government officials for \"having made such outstanding\
  \ trade deals with the United States\" in a postscript statement. On June 29th,\
  \ NBC[19] released a similar statement revealing its intention to end their business\
  \ relationship with Trump over his \"derogatory statements\" regarding immigrants.\
  \ \"To that end, the annual Miss USA and Miss Universe Pageants, which are part\
  \ of a joint venture between NBC and Trump, will no longer air on NBC,\" the statement\
  \ continued. \"In addition, as Mr. Trump has already indicated, he will not be participating\
  \ in The Celebrity Apprentice on NBC. Celebrity Apprentice is licensed from Mark\
  \ Burnett's United Artists Media Group and that relationship will continue.\" El\
  \ Chapo's Response On July 11th, 2015, the notorious Mexican drug kingpin Joaqu\xED\
  n \"El Chapo\" Guzm\xE1n Loera escaped from the Altiplano maximum security, leaving\
  \ through a 4,000 foot tunnel dug from a nearby home to the shower in his cell.[20]\
  \ Trump, continuing his criticism of border control and Mexican government in general,\
  \ responded directly and aggressively on Twitter on June 13th. According to media\
  \ accounts, a Twitter account called @ElChap0Guzman, purportedly run by one of Guzm\xE1\
  n Loera's sons and followed by over 470,000 people, tweeted to Trump on the evening\
  \ of July 12th, before Trump made the above remarks.[21] The tweet, now deleted,\
  \ read: Roughly translated, this means \"\u201Ckeep f***ing around and I\u2019m\
  \ gonna make you swallow your b**** words you f***ing whitey milk s***ter.\u201D\
  [22] On July 13th, ABCNews reported that Trump had asked the FBI to investigate\
  \ the threat.[23] Woman Reading a Book On November 10th, 2015, Vine user Vic Berger\
  \ IV uploaded a post featuring a remixed, zoomed in video from a Trump Rally in\
  \ Springfield, Illinois. The video featured clip of the televised footage where\
  \ an older man asks a woman to put down the book she is reading, to which the woman\
  \ reacts negatively. The video received over 16 million loops in less than one month.[40]\
  \ Later, in an interview with Jezebel, the woman, named Johari Osayi Idusuyi, revealed\
  \ that the book was Citizen by Claudia Rankine.[41] She said that she had attended\
  \ the rally out of curiosity, and that she and her (also black) friends had been\
  \ asked to sit directly behind Trump by campaign officials so that they would be\
  \ featured in the telecast, making Trump's support appear more diverse than it was.\
  \ Upon realizing that she was being used in this way, she read the book as an act\
  \ of silent protest. Black Lives Matter Protest Beating On November 21st, 2015,\
  \ six attendees at a Trump presidential rally in Birmingham, Alabama, \"shoved,\
  \ kicked, and tackled\" a Black Lives Matter protester who had attended the rally.[42]\
  \ The next day on Fox News, Trump suggested that the violent attendees had done\
  \ the right thing; \"Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely\
  \ disgusting what he was doing,\" he told the news anchors. Anti-Muslim Remarks\
  \ After the 2015 Paris Terrorist Attacks, Donald Trump made a series of anti-Muslim\
  \ remarks. Cheering Post 9/11 Muslims On November 22nd, Trump made a speech at a\
  \ rally where he called for surveillance of mosques, and claimed that he saw Muslims\
  \ in Jersey City, NJ (a town with an easy view of the lower Manhattan skyline) cheering\
  \ when the Twin Towers fell in the September 11th, 2001 attacks.[43] Later, Trump\
  \ reframed the remarks, saying that he had seen Muslims celebrate all over the world,\
  \ and criticized a reporter he was quoting, making fun of the reporter's physical\
  \ disability.[44] Muslim Immigration Ban After the 2015 San Bernardino Shooting,\
  \ Trump ramped up his calls for surveillance on Muslims, calling at first for a\
  \ database to be created, and then later, on December 7th, 2015, for all Muslims,\
  \ including American citizens, to be barred from entering the country.[45] During\
  \ a rally on the Yorktown Air Craft Carrier meant to commemorate Pearl Harbor Remembrance\
  \ Day, Trump called for the ban, saying it was a temporary solution meant to suffice\
  \ until the government could understand the ISIS threat to America more completely.\
  \ He published the proposal in its entirety on his web site:[46] Donald J. Trump\
  \ is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\
  \ until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. According\
  \ to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large\
  \ segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security\
  \ Policy released data showing \"25% of those polled agreed that violence against\
  \ Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad\"\
  \ and 51% of those polled, \"agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice\
  \ of being governed according to Shariah.\" Shariah authorizes such atrocities as\
  \ murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable\
  \ acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women. Mr. Trump stated, \"\
  Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred\
  \ is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to\
  \ determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the\
  \ dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks\
  \ by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for\
  \ human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America\
  \ Great Again.\" \u2013 Donald J. Trump Cinco De Mayo Taco Bowl Photo On May 5th,\
  \ 2016, a photograph of Donald Trump seated at his desk eating a taco bowl was posted\
  \ on the official Donald Trump Facebook[51] and Twitter[52] feeds, along with the\
  \ message \"Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.\
  \ I love Hispanics!\" (shown below). Within 24 hours, the Facebook post gained over\
  \ 578,700 likes and 560,000 shares, while the tweet received upwards of 99,000 likes\
  \ and 79,000 retweets. The posts were widely mocked online by many who speculated\
  \ that it was a poorly-executed publicity stunt and patronizing toward Hispanic\
  \ communities. That day, BuzzFeed[53] highlighted a critical Facebook comment from\
  \ user Andrea Mucino, which gathered more than 60,000 likes prior to its deletion\
  \ (shown below). Also on May 5th, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\
  \ quoted Trump's post in a tweet[55] criticizing his stance on illegal immigration\
  \ (shown below, left). Meanwhile, Giphy[54] user lectroid posted a looped animation\
  \ of Trump eating the taco bowl in front of a spinning American flag (shown below,\
  \ right). In the coming days, several news sites published articles about the online\
  \ backlash to the posts, including The Independent,[56] USA Today,[57] The New York\
  \ Times,[58] BBC[59] and Politico.[60] Anti-Semitic Tweet Controversy On June 15th,\
  \ 2016, Twitter user @FishBoneHead1[67], a self-described \"comedian,\" tweeted\
  \ an anti-Hillary Clinton poster featuring an image of a blue hexagram, clearly\
  \ resembling the Jewish Star of David (\u2721), with the caption reading \"Most\
  \ Corrupt Candidate Ever\" and set to the background image of a pile of $100 bills\
  \ (shown below, left). On June 22nd, an anonymous 8chan user reposted the same image\
  \ on the site's /pol/ board[61] (shown below, right). On July 2nd, Trump shared\
  \ the image via his Twitter account[62] (shown below, right), which quickly prompted\
  \ a firestorm of social media backlash from his critics and Clinton's supporters,\
  \ many of whom blasted the Republican presidential candidate for promoting anti-Semitic\
  \ imagery. Later that same day, not long after the term \"Star of David\" began\
  \ trending nationally on Twitter in the United States, the controversial tweet was\
  \ taken down by Trump's campaign team and replaced by an edited version of the same\
  \ image[63] without the six-pointed star (shown below, left). By the afternoon on\
  \ July 3rd, Trump's original tweet had been widely condemned by leaders of the Jewish\
  \ community and major U.S. news outlets[64][65][66] alike, though Trump's campaign\
  \ team continued to remain quiet in the wake of the controversy. That same day,\
  \ Mic[67] published an article titled \"Donald Trump's \"Star of David\" Hillary\
  \ Clinton Meme Was Created by White Supremacists,\" identifying @FishBoneHead1's\
  \ tweet as the origin of the anti-Clinton image. On July 4th, Trump issued a follow-up\
  \ statement[68] blaming the \"dishonest media\" for allegedly jumping to the conclusion\
  \ that the hexagram is a Jewish Star of David (shown below). Khiz Khan Controversy\
  \ On July 28th, 2016, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, Pakistani-born Americans and the parents\
  \ of American war veteran Captain Humayun Khan, made a special appearance at the\
  \ Democratic National Convention to deliver a speech in honor of their son, who\
  \ was killed in action by a car bomb during Operation Iraqi Freedom in June 2004.\
  \ During the speech, Khizr also criticized Donald Trump for his proposed ban on\
  \ Muslim immigration and questioned the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s understanding\
  \ of the United States Constitution. In an interview with ABC News, Trump reacted\
  \ to the speech by questioning if Ghazala Khan \u201Cwas allowed to have anything\
  \ to say,\u201D leading many to accuse him of making a bigoted statement toward\
  \ Muslim Americans. Trump's Response to Russian Interference After categorically\
  \ denying the Russians were behind 2016 United States Presidential Election Hack\
  \ on the Democratic National Committee, Trump admitted on January 11th, 2017, that\
  \ Russia was probably behind the attacks at an explosive press conference, his first\
  \ as President-elect.[80] He later stated it could have been from another country.\

  \ about Alicia Machado, a model and actress who won the Miss Universe pageant in\
  \ 1996, the first year Trump owned the pageant, to demonstrate Trump's demeaning\
  \ attitudes towards women. Early the morning of September 30th, 2016, Donald Trump\
  \ posted several tweets[71] suggesting Clinton had been \"duped\" by Machado or\
  \ that Clinton had helped Machado become a US Citizen so that she use her in the\
  \ debate. He also called Machado \"disgusting\" and invited people to \"check out\
  \ (her) sex tape and past).\"[72] Trump was referring to conservative claims meant\
  \ to smear Machado,[73] including that she had appeared in porn. Snopes[74] had\
  \ debunked such claims the day before, noting that the porn film she was reported\
  \ to have starred in starred lookalike adult film actress Angel Dark. There were\
  \ also claims that Machado had a sex tape, referring to her appearance on Spanish\
  \ reality television show La Granja, similar to America's The Real World. In the\
  \ show, Machado was filmed in bed with a cast member, though Snopes describes the\
  \ footage as \"nothing more than some grainy, night-vision footage of a couple of\
  \ covered figures writhing in a bed, (which) hardly qualifies as explicit.\" Later\
  \ that morning, several major media outlets covered Trump's tweets, including The\
  \ Daily Dot,[75] The Los Angeles Times,[76] The Chicago Tribune,[77] and many more.\
  \ The Trump Tapes On October 7th, 2016, two days before the second round of the\
  \ United States presidential debate, the Washington Post published a three-minute\
  \ hot microphone recording in which Trump can be heard making a series of vulgar\
  \ remarks about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women while sharing\
  \ a bus ride with former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush. After the recording began\
  \ circulating online, Trump was widely condemned for the comments, with many calling\
  \ them an admission of sexual assault. \u201CYou know I\u2019m automatically attracted\
  \ to beautiful--I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I\
  \ don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it, you can\
  \ do anything. \u2026 Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.\u201D Anti-Obama\
  \ Remarks In October 2012, American political pundit Stephen Colbert responded to\
  \ Trump's Birther accusations against Barack Obama by making a counteroffer saying\
  \ he would donate $1 million to the charity of his choice if he would allow Colbert\
  \ to \"dip his ball in his mouth.\"[10] The same night, Obama responded on The Tonight\
  \ Show[11], joking that his feud with Trump dated back to when they were growing\
  \ up together in Kenya. Grammarly Study On October 6th, 2015, the grammar checking\
  \ website Grammarly[33] published a blog post titled \"Presidential Debate Grammar\
  \ Power Rankings,\" which featured an infographic comparing Facebook grammar mistakes\
  \ made by supporters of various candidates in the 2016 United States presidential\
  \ election. The company pooled 180 samples per candidate over a period of four months,\
  \ showing that supporters of Donald Trump received the worst grammar score of any\
  \ candidate. In the coming days, several news sites reported on the study, including\
  \ USA Today,[35] The Washington Post,[36] The Telegraph[37], The Daily Dot[38] and\
  \ more.[34] On October 7th, an entry for the grammar study was created on Snopes,[39]\
  \ which noted that Grammarly's findings could not be considered a scientific study,\
  \ marking their claims as \"unproven.\" Tax Scandal On October 1st, 2016, after\
  \ receiving a leak of some of Trump\u2019s tax returns, The New York Times published\
  \ an article that revealed Trump had lost $916 million dollars in 1995, \u201Cfrom\
  \ the financial wreckage he left behind in the early 1990s through mismanagement\
  \ of three Atlantic City casinos, his ill-fated foray into the airline business\
  \ and his ill-timed purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.\u201D Because of American\
  \ tax laws, the loss would have wiped out over $50 million dollars in taxable income\
  \ over the next 18 years. \"Second Amendment People\" Joke On August 9th, 2016,\
  \ Donald Trump gave a speech in Wilmington, North Carolina where he tried to drum\
  \ up support by insinuating that Hillary Clinton would abolish the Second Amendment\
  \ that states Americans have the right to bear arms. While talking about the possibility\
  \ of Hillary nominating Supreme Court justices, Trump joked that perhaps \"Second\
  \ Amendment people\" could prevent her from picking anti-gun judges. Related Memes\

  \ Comment Section About Donald Trump, born June 14, 1946 (age 74), is an American\
  \ entrepreneur and TV personality best known for his celebrity billionaire status,\
  \ as portrayed in the hit NBC reality show The Apprentice, and advocacy of extremely\
  \ conservative political beliefs. In November 2016, Trump became the President-elect\
  \ of the United States after winning the 2016 general election in an upset victory\
  \ against his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. He served a term as president\
  \ before losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. In 2024, Trump was elected for his\
  \ second term in office after beating Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections Online\
  \ History The Birther Movement In March 2011, while exploring to make a bid for\
  \ the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, Trump began looking\
  \ into the validity of President Barack Obama's birth certificate[2], stating that\
  \ the \"Certification of Live Birth\" the White House released did not bear a signature\
  \ of authenticity.[5] He continued to question President Obama's birth certificate\
  \ throughout 2012, tweeting[3] on August 6th, 2012 that the produced certificate\
  \ was a fraud. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that\
  \ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/barackobama\">barackobama</a>'s birth certificate\
  \ is a fraud.</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (realDonaldTrump) August 6, 2012 On October\
  \ 22nd, 2012, Trump asserted he would be making a \"very big\" revelation about\
  \ the president within two days.[6] On the 24th, Trump released a video (shown below,\
  \ left) stating he would donate $5 million dollars to the charity of the President's\
  \ choice if he provided his college applications and records as well as his passport\
  \ records by October 31st to the billionaire's satisfaction. Many news sources including\
  \ CBS News[7], Business Insider[8] and the Huffington Post[9] claimed the announcement\
  \ fell flat of his Twitter hype. 2012 Presidential Election Reaction Following the\
  \ 2012 United States Presidential Election, Trump published several angry tweets\
  \ about Barack Obama's election for a second term as President of the United States.\
  \ \"Wow\" Chain Tweets On February 25th, 2013, Trump published a tweet promoting\

  \ Erik Schmidt tweeted a link to Gurman's tweet with the word \"Wow,\" a trend was\

  \ \u2014 Erik Schmidt (@shmdy) February 26, 2013 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign\
  \ On June 16th, 2015, Trump formally announced his bid for the Republican primaries\
  \ in the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election at the Trump Tower in Manhattan,\
  \ New York City. During his 45-minute long announcement speech, the longest of any\
  \ major party candidates to date, Trump made several pledges in a wide range of\
  \ policy areas to \"restore the American Dream\" and become \"the greatest 'jobs'\
  \ president God ever created\" under his trademarked campaign slogan \"Make America\
  \ Great Again,\" including plans for an overhaul of the fiscally troubled Social\
  \ Security program, re-negotiation of the U.S. trade agreements, opposition against\
  \ the federally sponsored Common Core State Standards Initiative in education and\
  \ completion of the U.S.-Mexican border fence. [This video has been removed] Trump's\
  \ announcement was immediately picked up by virtually all major news outlets, including\
  \ both traditional and online publications, generating the highest volume of Google\
  \ search queries for any of the presidential candidates to date. In the weeks following\
  \ his announcement, at least two public opinion polls were conducted by the Suffolk\
  \ University and Fox News, with the former survey indicating Trump as the second\
  \ most popular Republican candidate among likely voters in New Hampshire's primary\
  \ for the Republican nomination and the latter poll similarly placing Trump in second\
  \ place among Republican-registered voters nationwide. Senator Lindsey Graham's\
  \ Phone Number On July 21st, 2015, Donald Trump launched a tirade against Republican\
  \ senator Lindsey Graham while giving a speech at a campaign rally event in South\
  \ Carolina, shortly after the circulation of headlines[25] that his rival primary\
  \ candidate called him a \"jackass\" on the previous day. During his speech[26],\
  \ Trump shot back at the South Carolina senator by calling him a \u201Clightweight\u201D\
  \ and an \u201Cidiot,\" while making a disparaging comparison to another Republican\
  \ presidential candidate Rick Perry. \u201CHe doesn\u2019t seem like a very bright\
  \ guy. He actually probably seems to me not as bright as Rick Perry. I think Rick\
  \ Perry probably is smarter than Lindsey Graham.\" Trump then wrapped up his diatribe\
  \ by reading out the private phone number belonging to Lindsey Graham and encouraging\
  \ his supporters to \"try it.\" Trump's Phone Number Leak On August 3rd, 2015, Gawker[24]\
  \ leaked a mobile phone number belonging to Donald Trump in an article titled \"\
  Call Donald Trump's Cell Phone and Ask Him About His Important Ideas.\" Prefaced\
  \ with a note about Trump's disclosure of Republican senator Lindsey Graham's phone\
  \ number at a campaign rally in July, the publication called on its readers to ask\
  \ him questions by dialing the listed number: You can reach Donald Trump at 917-756-8000.\
  \ He has some pressing questions to answer. Does he still think Mexicans are out\
  \ to rape you? Speaking of rape, does he think it\u2019s possible to rape your own\

  \ The next day, Trump issued a personally-signed open letter in response to Univision's\

  \ asked to sit directly behind Trump by campaign officials so that they would be\
  \ featured in the telecast, making Trump's support appear more diverse than it was.\
  \ Upon realizing that she was being used in this way, she read the book as an act\

  \ After the 2015 Paris Terrorist Attacks, Donald Trump made a series of anti-Muslim\
  \ remarks. Cheering Post 9/11 Muslims On November 22nd, Trump made a speech at a\
  \ rally where he called for surveillance of mosques, and claimed that he saw Muslims\
  \ in Jersey City, NJ (a town with an easy view of the lower Manhattan skyline) cheering\
  \ when the Twin Towers fell in the September 11th, 2001 attacks.[43] Later, Trump\
  \ reframed the remarks, saying that he had seen Muslims celebrate all over the world,\
  \ and criticized a reporter he was quoting, making fun of the reporter's physical\
  \ disability.[44] Muslim Immigration Ban After the 2015 San Bernardino Shooting,\
  \ Trump ramped up his calls for surveillance on Muslims, calling at first for a\
  \ database to be created, and then later, on December 7th, 2015, for all Muslims,\
  \ including American citizens, to be barred from entering the country.[45] During\
  \ a rally on the Yorktown Air Craft Carrier meant to commemorate Pearl Harbor Remembrance\
  \ Day, Trump called for the ban, saying it was a temporary solution meant to suffice\
  \ until the government could understand the ISIS threat to America more completely.\
  \ He published the proposal in its entirety on his web site:[46] Donald J. Trump\
  \ is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\
  \ until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. According\
  \ to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large\
  \ segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security\
  \ Policy released data showing \"25% of those polled agreed that violence against\
  \ Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad\"\
  \ and 51% of those polled, \"agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice\
  \ of being governed according to Shariah.\" Shariah authorizes such atrocities as\
  \ murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable\
  \ acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women. Mr. Trump stated, \"\
  Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred\
  \ is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to\
  \ determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the\
  \ dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks\
  \ by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for\

  \ During the speech, Khizr also criticized Donald Trump for his proposed ban on\
  \ Muslim immigration and questioned the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s understanding\
  \ of the United States Constitution. In an interview with ABC News, Trump reacted\
  \ to the speech by questioning if Ghazala Khan \u201Cwas allowed to have anything\
  \ to say,\u201D leading many to accuse him of making a bigoted statement toward\
  \ Muslim Americans. Trump's Response to Russian Interference After categorically\

  \ Gender-Related Controversies 1996 Miss Universe In the first Presidential Debate\

  \ attitudes towards women. Early the morning of September 30th, 2016, Donald Trump\
  \ posted several tweets[71] suggesting Clinton had been \"duped\" by Machado or\
  \ that Clinton had helped Machado become a US Citizen so that she use her in the\

  \ to smear Machado,[73] including that she had appeared in porn. Snopes[74] had\
  \ debunked such claims the day before, noting that the porn film she was reported\
  \ to have starred in starred lookalike adult film actress Angel Dark. There were\
  \ also claims that Machado had a sex tape, referring to her appearance on Spanish\
  \ reality television show La Granja, similar to America's The Real World. In the\
  \ show, Machado was filmed in bed with a cast member, though Snopes describes the\
  \ footage as \"nothing more than some grainy, night-vision footage of a couple of\
  \ covered figures writhing in a bed, (which) hardly qualifies as explicit.\" Later\

  \ remarks about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women while sharing\
  \ a bus ride with former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush. After the recording began\

  \ the financial wreckage he left behind in the early 1990s through mismanagement\
  \ of three Atlantic City casinos, his ill-fated foray into the airline business\
  \ and his ill-timed purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.\u201D Because of American\

  \ Donation Hoax The NAMBLA Donation Hoax refers to the false rumor that Trump refused\

  \ made to the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), a pedophile and\
  \ pedrasty advocacy organization. #ManyPeopleAreSaying #ManyPeopleAreSaying is a\

  \ Chess is an expression used by Trump supporters when speculating that his presidential\
  \ campaign was using advanced political strategies to manipulate and dominate the\
  \ news media. \"Soft Sensuality\" Remark On January 10th, 2017, after Trump's team\
  \ had a notoriously difficult time booking celebrities to play his inauguration,\
  \ Buzzfeed[78] published a statement from inauguration planner Tom Barrack that\
  \ said the January 20th inauguration would not be a \"coronation,\" but rather have\
  \ a \"soft sensuality\" and \"poetic cadence\" (shown below). The phrase \"soft\
  \ sensuality\" struck Twitter users as odd, and they began making jokes with sexual\
  \ undertones regarding the inauguration, which were compiled in a Twitter Moment[79]\
