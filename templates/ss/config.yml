  \ animal character based on a photograph of a youth dressed in baggy clothes with\

  \ wreak havoc in various social situations. Origin The original image came from\
  \ the cover of the album \"Ma Gangsta\"[1] by the rap group Beantown Mafia.[2] The\
  \ first known image macros were posted in a compilation to Reddit[3] in a thread\
  \ that reached the front page on January 21st, 2011 and received 8,607 up votes\

  \ with references to smoking etiquettes and commonly shared experiences under the\
  \ influence of cannabis. Blake later confirmed his appreciation of the marijuana\
  \ enthusiast subreddit, /trees. Derivatives A number of notable spin-off instances\

  \ Letter On December 21st, 2011, Slacktory[22] editor Nick Douglas published an\
  \ open letter from Blake Boston to the Annoying Facebook Girl in which he gives\
  \ advice about how to deal with unintended Internet fame. Dear Annoying Facebook\
  \ Girl, it\u2019s me Blake. You may know me as Scumbag Steve. Or not, if you\u2019\
  re not on the internet much. I heard you just found out that your pics been all\
  \ over the internet. Shocking huh? Google yourself, but have a friend with you for\
  \ support. Feeling violated? Don\u2019t. You see, like me, your picture was used\
  \ as a meme. What the fuck, you may ask, is a meme? Well basically it\u2019s you\
  \ and others in image macro form, that represent a thought, behavior, style or idea\
  \ that spreads from person to person within a culture. Waaah? Let me say it again.\
  \ It\u2019s one random picture, with various sayings on it, that tells a whole story,\
  \ in really short form, for the world to see, it gets put on the internet and it\
  \ spreads. Goes viral, like the worst case of herpes known to man. But before you\
  \ feel like you\u2019re going to jump, you need to know that it\u2019s going to\
  \ be OK. Now don\u2019t have your folks look for a meme support group for you, cuz\
  \ there isn\u2019t one. We\u2019re out here by ourselves. You may feel hurt and\
  \ embarrassed that somehow one of your friends or foes took that godawful picture\
  \ of you (we know you really don\u2019t look like that all the time, right?) and\
  \ put it where the internet meme makers dwell. 4chan. Don\u2019t go there, especially\
  \ if your parents are looking. You see, that pic resonated with people. It spoke\
  \ of a crazy excited girl telling Facebook friends inane shit. It could have been\
  \ any girl, there\u2019s a million pics just like yours on Facebook. But it happened\
  \ to be yours. Now, if you do see a pic of me, try not to go all wifey on me but\
  \ (scumbag joke, these memes can get inside your head) that too was a pic of me\
  \ a little younger, looking like a scumbag. Let\u2019s face it. The pics look pretty\
  \ true to form. But here\u2019s what I need you to know. When you go off to college,\
  \ and you\u2019re walking down the hall and a group of kids see you and scream,\
  \ \u201COh my god it\u2019s Annoying Facebook Girl,\u201D don\u2019t cry. You see.\
  \ Some people can\u2019t distinguish the internet from real life. There are people\
  \ who refuse to believe my name isn\u2019t Steve and that I am not really the scumbag\
  \ (well not all the time, that is). Just remember who you are. And that you know\
  \ you\u2019re a decent kid. You\u2019re going to be in shock for a while, when you\
  \ see what people have written. But the most important and self-preserving thing\
  \ you can do is know that it\u2019s not you. You can\u2019t take this personally.\
  \ I\u2019ll say that again, you can\u2019t take this personally. Hell if I did\u2026\
  \ well let\u2019s not go there. The part that will suck though is that there will\
  \ always be those people that somehow think YOU did this, that you made the meme,\
  \ and that you could stop it if you wanted to. That you have some control over it.\
  \ You don\u2019t. The internet birthed you and they\u2019ll decide when you (the\
  \ meme) will die. There will also be those people who assuage their guilt by telling\
  \ you how great it is, how lucky you are to be a meme. Just smile. What they are\
  \ really saying is, thank god it wasn\u2019t me. So search Annoying Facebook Girl\
  \ on Google images, pull up a chair with a group of your friends and laugh your\
  \ fucking ass off. Cuz you know who you are and how strong you are and that, that\
  \ picture has nothing to do with what makes you, you\u2026 Hopefully you\u2019ll\
  \ get to where I am, feeling like some memes are hysterical. But that takes time.\
  \ I\u2019m here if you need me. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting, -- Blake, a.k.a.\
  \ Scumbag Steve Rap Career On January 20th, 2012, Blake was interviewed by the hip\
  \ hop music blog Tech N9ne[23] and revealed that while he still wants to make music,\
