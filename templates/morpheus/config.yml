  \ an advice animal image macro series featuring a screen capture of the fictional\
  \ character Morpheus[1] (played by Lawrence Fishburne) from The Matrix franchise.[2]\
  \ The captions typically follow a two line format with the first line reading \"\
  What if I Told You,\" followed by a revelation that often belittles futile or petty\
  \ behavior, in a similar vein to the advice animal characters Conspiracy Keanu and\
  \ Sudden Clarity Clarence. Origin While the line \u201CWhat if I told you\u201D\
  \ was never heard in any of the Matrix films, it thought to be a paraphrased interpretation\
  \ of a scene from The Matrix in which Morpheus informs the protagonist Neo (played\
  \ by Keanu Reeves) that he lives in is a computer simulation (shown below, left).\
  \ A different screen capture used in many of the image macros comes from a scene\
  \ in which Morpheus warns Neo about the artificial intelligence programs known as\
  \ \"Agents\" (shown below, right). On February 11th, 2012, Redditor haveacigaro\
  \ submitted a post titled \"Morpheus Uses a Mac\" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[4] subreddit,\

  \ Macintosh computer users how to take a screenshot using a keyboard shortcut (shown\
  \ below). Spread On March 27th, 2012, Redditor matthewkol186 submitted a Matrix\
