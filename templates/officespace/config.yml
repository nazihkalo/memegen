  \ 1999 comedy film Office Space. The captions typically mimic the character's non-confrontational\
  \ speech with various requests ending with the expression \"That'd be great.\" Origin\
  \ The film Office Space was released on February 19th, 1999, in which the protagonist\
  \ Peter Gibbons (played by Ron Livingston) is repeatedly exploited by his boss Bill\
  \ Lumbergh (played by Gary Cole), a stereotype of a corporate manager who focuses\
  \ on pointless paperwork and asks employees to work over the weekend. On September\
  \ 7th, 2011, Redditor Mekrob submitted a \"read this in my voice\" image macro to\
  \ the /r/pics[1] subreddit, which featured a screen capture of Lumbergh with the\
  \ caption \"Yeeeaah, if you could just, go ahead and read this in my voice, that'd\
  \ be great\" (shown below). Prior to being archived, the post received over 480\
  \ up votes and 25 comments. Spread On October 10th, 2011, Redditor AnkenTEM submitted\
  \ a post titled \"That'd be great\" to the /r/pics[6] subreddit, featuring a photograph\
  \ of a hybrid cosplayer dressed as Lumbergh and Darth Vader from Star Wars with\
  \ the caption \"Yeah, if you could just, come to the dark side, that'd be great\"\
  \ (shown below, left). Prior to being archived, the post received over 3,400 upvotes\
  \ and 40 comments. On May 13th, 2012, Redditor isntthatironic submitted a post titled\
  \ \"Lumbergh Cat\" to the /r/AdviceAnimals[5] subreddit, featuring a photoshopped\
  \ screen capture of Lumbergh with a superimposed cat's head and the caption \"Yeeaaaaahhhhh\
