Confirmed 295,633 Navigation About • Origin • Spread • Search Interest • External References • Recent Images About IQ Bell Curve, also known as Midwit, refers to a series of memes that use the IQ distribution diagrams to mock one of the three main groups represented by the diagram, usually the largest group of people towards the center of the curve who possess average intelligence. The concept of IQ Bell Curve memes utilizes the horseshoe theory, implying that the groups with low intelligence and high intelligence often choose to follow the same goals while being guided by different reasoning. Those who possess average intelligence are referred to as \"midwits.\" While there were many versions of memes illustrating the concept, a variant of the meme using three different Wojaks gained particular popularity in the 2020s on X / Twitter and Reddit. Origin The word \"mid-witted\" was popularized by far-right activist and writer Vox Day. On February 17th, 2012, Vox Day[1] published the blog post \"The tragedy of the mid-witted\" in which he commented on a life story article \"Lessons of a very sexy pirate costume\" by Jennifer Wright.[2] In the blog post, Vox Day wrote, \"Those who possess above-average intelligence and trouble to occasionally read newspapers and magazines tend to genuinely be under the erroneous impression that they possess superlative intelligence\" (extract shown below). The term \"midwit,\" meaning a person of average intelligence, saw use on 4chan starting in late 2013 (example posts shown below).[3][4][5] On January 1st, 2017, an anonymous 4chan[6] user made the earliest found post that used the IQ bell curve diagram to argue about the similarity of political views of groups with low and high intelligence (shown below). The format did not see further use until December 2018. On December 14th, 2018, an anonymous /pol/ user[7] used the diagram to make a claim that people of both low intelligence and high intelligence are racist (shown below, left), with another user posting[8] an edited version of the diagram on the same day (shown below, right). Note: the images contain an uncensored racial slur; discretion advised. Spread Throughout 2019, the the edited image was reposted[9][10] on 4chan multiple times. On June 24th, 2019, an anonymous /pol/[11] user posted a Manlet meme referencing the horseshoe theory interpretation of the IQ bell curve (shown below, left). Several variations of the format were posted on /pol/[12][13][14] in late 2019 and early 2020 (example shown below, right). The viral popularity of the format began on March 10th, 2010, when an anonymous 4chan[15] user posted a meme about Ted Kaczynski and the anarcho-primitivistic ideology (shown below, left). On the same day, the user[16] launched the first \"midwit memes\" thread which gained 12 replies (shown below, right). In mid-March, the meme format in which the IQ bell curve was used to ridicule people of average intelligence, referred to as \"midwits,\" gained significant popularity on /pol/ board, with multiple variations of the meme being posted[17][18] in the following weeks. After the viral spread on 4chan, the format also gained notable popularity on Facebook, with variations of the meme also appearing on other platforms in the following months. Crossover Beyond 4chan A version of the meme featuring three different Wojaks arrayed on an IQ Bell Curve chart gained increasing popularity in the early 2020s. At the lowest IQ level is a variant of Brainlet, in the middle of the curve is a Midwit crying Wojak and at the top end is a monk-like Wojak wearing a cloak. In this version, the Monk Wojak and the Brainlet Wojak agree with one another while the Midwit Wojak offers an unnecessarily complicated analysis. The earliest version of this posting came from the X account @owenbroadcast on July 11th, 2020 (seen below), earning over 2,200 likes in the course of three and a half years.[19] Following the @owenbroadcast post, versions of the meme using these three Wojaks and this background became dominant across X, Reddit and other platforms. On /r/dndmemes on January 3rd, 2021, the meme (seen below, top) earned over 4,100 upvotes in three years.[20] On /r/okbuddyphd on October 15th, 2022, a posting (seen below, bottom) riffing off the IQ bell curve format earned over 2,100 upvotes over the course of a year.[21] Search Interest External References [1] Vox Day – The tragedy of the mid-witted [2] Salon – Lessons of a very sexy pirate costume [3] 4chan – /pol/ Post #23691479 [4] 4chan – /pol/ Post #50667913 [5] 4chan – /r9k/ Post #28347169 [6] 4chan – /pol/ Thread #105290193 [7] 4chan – /pol/ Post #196643836 [8] 4chan – /pol/ Post #196672446 [9] 4chan – /pol/ Thread #227414002 [10] 4chan – /pol/ Thread #228648992 [11] 4chan – /pol/ Post #10751356 [12] 4chan – /pol/ Thread #228648992 [13] 4chan – /pol/ Post #236324288 [14] 4chan – /pol/ Post #240385631 [15] 4chan – /pol/ Post #247368790 [16] 4chan – /pol/ Thread #247369006 [17] 4chan – /pol/ Post #248043341 [18] 4chan – /pol/ Post #248044758 [19] X – @owenbroadcast [20] Reddit – /r/dndmemes [21] Reddit – /r/okbuddyphd midwit iq bell curve distribution curve intelligence quotient intelligence /pol/ iq score horseshoe theory jennifer wright bell curve memes iq score graph meme Share Pin Recent Images 111 total View All Images Recent Videos 0 total There are no recent videos.

The concept of IQ Bell Curve memes\\\\\\n  \\\\ utilizes the horseshoe theory, implying that the groups with low intelligence\\\\\\n  \\\\ and high intelligence often choose to follow the same goals while being guided\\\\\\n  \\\\ by different reasoning. Those who possess average intelligence are referred to\\\\\\n  \\\\ as \\\\\"midwits.\\\\\" While there were many versions of memes illustrating the concept,\\\\\\n  \\\\ a variant of the meme using three different Wojaks gained particular popularity\\\\\\n  \\\\ in the 2020s on X / Twitter and Reddit. Origin The word \\\\\"mid-witted\\\\\" was popularized\\\\\\n  \\\\ by far-right activist and writer Vox Day. On February 17th, 2012, Vox Day[1] published\\\\\\n  \\\\ the blog post \\\\\"The tragedy of the mid-witted\\\\\" in which he commented on a life\\\\\\n  \\\\ story article \\\\\"Lessons of a very sexy pirate costume\\\\\" by Jennifer Wright.[2]\\\\\\n  \\\\ In the blog post, Vox Day wrote, \\\\\"Those who possess above-average intelligence\\\\\\n  \\\\ and trouble to occasionally read newspapers and magazines tend to genuinely be\\\\\\n  \\\\ under the erroneous impression that they possess superlative intelligence\\\\\" (extract\\\\\\n  \\\\ shown below). The term \\\\\"midwit,\\\\\" meaning a person of average intelligence, saw\\\\\\n  \\\\ use on 4chan starting in late 2013 (example posts shown below).[3][4][5] On January\\\\\\n  \\\\ 1st, 2017, an anonymous 4chan[6] user made the earliest found post that used the\\\\\\n  \\\\ IQ bell curve diagram to argue about the similarity of political views of groups\\\\\\n  \\\\ with low and high intelligence (shown below). The format did not see further use\\\\\\n  \\\\ until December 2018. On December 14th, 2018, an anonymous /pol/ user[7] used the\\\\\\n  \\\\ diagram to make a claim that people of both low intelligence and high intelligence\\\\\\n  \\\\ are racist (shown below, left), with another user posting[8] an edited version\\\\\\n  \\\\ of the diagram on the same day (shown below, right). Note: the images contain\\\\\\n  \\\\ an uncensored racial slur; discretion advised. Spread Throughout 2019, the the\\\\\\n  \\\\ edited image was reposted[9][10] on 4chan multiple times. On June 24th, 2019,\\\\\\n  \\\\ an anonymous /pol/[11] user posted a Manlet meme referencing the horseshoe theory\\\\\\n  \\\\ interpretation of the IQ bell curve (shown below, left). Several variations of\\\\\\n  \\\\ the format were posted on /pol/[12][13][14] in late 2019 and early 2020 (example\\\\\\n  \\\\ shown below, right). The viral popularity of the format began on March 10th, 2010,\\\\\\n  \\\\ when an anonymous 4chan[15] user posted a meme about Ted Kaczynski and the anarcho-primitivistic\\\\\\n  \\\\ ideology (shown below, left). On the same day, the user[16] launched the first\\\\\\n  \\\\ \\\\\"midwit memes\\\\\" thread which gained 12 replies (shown below, right). In mid-March,\\\\\\n  \\\\ the meme format in which the IQ bell curve was used to ridicule people of average\\\\\\n  \\\\ intelligence, referred to as \\\\\"midwits,\\\\\" gained significant popularity on /pol/\\\\\\n  \\\\ board, with multiple variations of the meme being posted[17][18] in the following\\\\\\n  \\\\ weeks. After the viral spread on 4chan, the format also gained notable popularity\\\\\\n  \\\\ on Facebook, with variations of the meme also appearing on other platforms in\\\\\\n  \\\\ the following months. Crossover Beyond 4chan A version of the meme featuring three\\\\\\n  \\\\ different Wojaks arrayed on an IQ Bell Curve chart gained increasing popularity\\\\\\n  \\\\ in the early 2020s. At the lowest IQ level is a variant of Brainlet, in the middle\\\\\\n  \\\\ of the curve is a Midwit crying Wojak and at the top end is a monk-like Wojak\\\\\\n  \\\\ wearing a cloak. In this version, the Monk Wojak and the Brainlet Wojak agree\\\\\\n  \\\\ with one another while the Midwit Wojak offers an unnecessarily complicated analysis.\\\\\\n  \\\\ The earliest version of this posting came from the X account @owenbroadcast on\\\\\\n  \\\\ July 11th, 2020 (seen below), earning over 2,200 likes in the course of three\\\\\\n  \\\\ and a half years.[19] Following the @owenbroadcast post, versions of the meme\\\\\\n  \\\\ using these three Wojaks and this background became dominant across X, Reddit\\\\\\n  \\\\ and other platforms.

The dog\\'s real name is Balltze, also nicknamed Ball Ball. In memes, he is known for liking cheeseburgers, which the Shiba Inu pronounces, \"Cheemsburbger.\" Memes featuring Cheems are usually based upon the character humorously misspelling various words, particularly by including extra \"M\" letters and first appeared on /r/dogelore in June 2019.

In image macros and comments, variations of the phrasal template “We’ll create our own (X) with blackjack and hookers” have been used to express dissatisfaction with the status quo, suggesting that the commenter could do it better. Origin The phrase was first uttered in the second episode of _Futurama_\\'s first season titled \"The Series Has Landed\"[1], which originally aired on April 4th, 1999. While on a trip to an amusement park on the moon, robotic anti-hero Bender is caught reaching through an arcade claw machine prize slot while trying to retrieve a set of lost keys and is ejected from the building. As he lands on the moon\\'s surface, he exclaims \"I am going to build my own theme park with blackjack and hookers!\" After walking back to the group\\'s spaceship, Bender sees the door close and thinks they are about to leave without him, causing him to utter the phrase again in reference to building his own lunar lander. [This video has been removed] Spread The quote was discussed online as early as April 2003, when a thread dedicated to it was created on the Prince.org forums.[2] That November, the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary[3], where it was described as a phrasal template used when someone gets kicked out of a physical place or group. In October 2007, it was used as the title of a personal blog post[5], describing how a graphic designer created a specific lighting shader program after someone deemed it impossible. In January 2008, the phrase was used on Reddit[6] for the first time by a Ron Paul opposer who was joking about creating a version of Reddit without any mentions of the politician. The post gained 5 upvotes but 0 points overall. On October 29th, 2009, a Facebook fan page titled \"Blackjack and Hookers\"[4] was created, accruing 413 likes as of September 2013. That year, the phrase \"Blackjack and Hookers\" was used as the title of an achievement in the Xbox game Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days.[16] In January 2010, the subreddit /r/BlackjackAndHookers[7] launched, gaining nearly 400 subscribers as of September 2013. A second Facebook fan page[8] for the phrase was established on April 18th, 2010. Between 2010 and 2011, the phrase was used to describe people wanting to create their own mobile operating systems[9], message board art threads[10] and Minecraft buildings from scratch.[11] By December 2011[13], the phrase had become associated with an image of Bender wearing a white fur coat and several gold rings taken from the February 27th, 2000 episode \"Raging Bender.\"[12] Notable Examples As of September 2013, there are two Meme Generator pages[14][15] utilizing the image of Bender in the fur coat with captions relating to blackjack and hookers, with more than 10,000 submissions combined.

Between 2010 and 2011, the phrase was used to describe people wanting to create their own mobile operating systems[9], message board art threads[10] and Minecraft buildings from scratch.[11] By December 2011[13], the phrase had become associated with an image of Bender wearing a white fur coat and several gold rings taken from the February 27th, 2000 episode \"Raging Bender.\"[12] Notable Examples As of September 2013, there are two Meme Generator pages[14][15] utilizing the image of Bender in the fur coat with captions relating to blackjack and hookers, with more than 10,000 submissions combined.

Added 2 years ago / Updated 12 days ago Confirmed 70,568 Part of a series on Seinfeld. [View Related Entries] View All 129 Images Featured Episode Navigation About • Origin • Spread • Various Examples • Templates • Search Interest • External References • Recent Images • Recent Videos About Kramer, What\\'s Going On In There? refers to an exploitable image macro taken from a 1996 episode of Seinfeld where Jerry Seinfeld asks Kramer (played by Michael Richards) what is going on inside his apartment that is emitting a bright red light. The template was first used on Facebook in late 2021 but picked up in abundance in early 2022, where meme creators inserted their own subculture references and photoshopped the original scene. Origin The template originates from episode eight of Seinfeld\\'s eighth season called, \"The Chicken Roaster.\"[1] In the episode, a chicken restaurant with an unusually bright-red sign opens up across the street from Kramer\\'s apartment. The restaurant\\'s sign is so bright that it drives Kramer crazy and Jerry and Kramer end up switching apartments in the episode. When Jerry first notices the red light in the episode, he asks Kramer, \"What\\'s going on in there?\" The clip from the episode was uploaded to YouTube [2] on August 23rd, 2009, by the channel SolidSnake986 (shown below). Over the course of 11 years, the video gained roughly 250,200 views and 800 likes. The image macro template was first used on Facebook in September 2021 in the Facebook[17] group Seinfeld SoupPosting. The earliest publicly available meme based on the format, a crossover post between Facebook groups Seinfeld SoupPosting and Halo Plasmaposting, was reposted to Twitter by the Twitter[18] page @Plasmaposting on September 23rd, 2021. The meme (shown below) references the Halo video game franchise. Over the course of three months, the tweet received over 280 likes. Spread Starting in October 2021, the format achieved notable popularity in Seinfeld SoupPosting Facebook group.[19][20] On October 24th, 2021, Twitter[3] user _QuietLeader_ reposted another version of the format (shown below), a meme referencing the Dune universe. The meme was most likely inspired by the release of the Dune (2021) movie around that time. The tweet received 178 likes over the course of two months. On November 20th, 2021, Facebook[14] user Chris Scott posted a meme to the Star Trek Shitposting Facebook group (shown below, left) that referenced \"The Rite of Ascension\"[5] within the Klingon people of Star Trek. The post received roughly 1,000 reactions over the course of a month and a half. Facebook[15] page Geek Club posted a different version of Scott\\'s meme the next day (shown below, right), replacing the text with yellow, subtitle text. Their post received 276 reactions in the same amount of time. The template circulated Facebook going into December 2021. For instance, Facebook[16] user Erik Saucedo posted a version of the template on December 19th to the Halo Plasmaposting Facebook group. The meme (shown below) received 976 reactions over three weeks. In January 2022, the template was used en masse on Twitter. On January 6th, 2022, Twitter[4] user derpman47 reposted the Star Trek version of the meme. The tweet received roughly 20,300 likes over the course of four days. It was also reposted to platforms like Tumblr [6] on the same day, where it received roughly 9,200 notes over the same amount of time. The first variant on Twitter was posted within the replies of the above Twitter meme by Twitter[7] user owainjam on January 7th, 2022. The meme (shown below) references Michael Richard\\'s infamous \"N-word rant\"[8] at the L.A. Laugh Factory in 2007 — a stand-up set that he was subsequently canceled for. The meme received 47 likes in three days. More Twitter users exploited the template going into the rest of January.

Featured Episode Meme Status Confirmed Type: Exploitable, Image Macro, Pop Culture Reference Year 1996 Origin Seinfeld Tags kramer, seinfeld, meme, memes, michael richards, exploitables, kramer red room meme, red room, image macros, what\\'s going on in there About Kramer, What\\'s Going On In There? refers to an exploitable image macro taken from a 1996 episode of Seinfeld where Jerry Seinfeld asks Kramer (played by Michael Richards) what is going on inside his apartment that is emitting a bright red light. The template was first used on Facebook in late 2021 but picked up in abundance in early 2022, where meme creators inserted their own subculture references and photoshopped the original scene. Origin The template originates from episode eight of Seinfeld\\'s eighth season called, \"The Chicken Roaster.\"[1] In the episode, a chicken restaurant with an unusually bright-red sign opens up across the street from Kramer\\'s apartment. The restaurant\\'s sign is so bright that it drives Kramer crazy and Jerry and Kramer end up switching apartments in the episode. When Jerry first notices the red light in the episode, he asks Kramer, \"What\\'s going on in there?\" The clip from the episode was uploaded to YouTube [2] on August 23rd, 2009, by the channel SolidSnake986 (shown below). Over the course of 11 years, the video gained roughly 250,200 views and 800 likes. The image macro template was first used on Facebook in September 2021 in the Facebook[17] group Seinfeld SoupPosting. The earliest publicly available meme based on the format, a crossover post between Facebook groups Seinfeld SoupPosting and Halo Plasmaposting, was reposted to Twitter by the Twitter[18] page @Plasmaposting on September 23rd, 2021. The meme (shown below) references the Halo video game franchise. Over the course of three months, the tweet received over 280 likes. Spread Starting in October 2021, the format achieved notable popularity in Seinfeld SoupPosting Facebook group.[19][20] On October 24th, 2021, Twitter[3] user _QuietLeader_ reposted another version of the format (shown below), a meme referencing the Dune universe. The meme was most likely inspired by the release of the Dune (2021) movie around that time. The tweet received 178 likes over the course of two months. On November 20th, 2021, Facebook[14] user Chris Scott posted a meme to the Star Trek Shitposting Facebook group (shown below, left) that referenced \"The Rite of Ascension\"[5] within the Klingon people of Star Trek. The post received roughly 1,000 reactions over the course of a month and a half. Facebook[15] page Geek Club posted a different version of Scott\\'s meme the next day (shown below, right), replacing the text with yellow, subtitle text. Their post received 276 reactions in the same amount of time. The template circulated Facebook going into December 2021. For instance, Facebook[16] user Erik Saucedo posted a version of the template on December 19th to the Halo Plasmaposting Facebook group. The meme (shown below) received 976 reactions over three weeks. In January 2022, the template was used en masse on Twitter. On January 6th, 2022, Twitter[4] user derpman47 reposted the Star Trek version of the meme. The tweet received roughly 20,300 likes over the course of four days. It was also reposted to platforms like Tumblr [6] on the same day, where it received roughly 9,200 notes over the same amount of time. The first variant on Twitter was posted within the replies of the above Twitter meme by Twitter[7] user owainjam on January 7th, 2022. The meme (shown below) references Michael Richard\\'s infamous \"N-word rant\"[8] at the L.A. Laugh Factory in 2007 — a stand-up set that he was subsequently canceled for. The meme received 47 likes in three days. More Twitter users exploited the template going into the rest of January. For instance, Twitter[9] user buckadeath posted a version on January 8th, 2022 (shown below, left), that referenced Balrogs from The Lord of the Rings universe. The meme received roughly 48,500 likes in two days. Twitter[10] user SilentDawnLB also posted a variant on January 8th (shown below, right) that referenced the movie The Thing.

The template was first used on Facebook in late 2021 but picked\\\\\\n  \\\\ up in abundance in early 2022, where meme creators inserted their own subculture\\\\\\n  \\\\ references and photoshopped the original scene. Origin The template originates\\\\\\n  \\\\ from episode eight of Seinfeld\\'s eighth season called, \\\\\"The Chicken Roaster.\\\\\"\\\\\\n  [1] In the episode, a chicken restaurant with an unusually bright-red sign opens\\\\\\n  \\\\ up across the street from Kramer\\'s apartment.
